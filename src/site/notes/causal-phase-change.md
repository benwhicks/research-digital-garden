All phenomena happens at a particular scale, or bounds of measurement. Even something as (relatively) well understood as gravity has bounds. 

More concretely phenomena tends to be locally linear in how it acts, as in it has [[linear-causality\|linear causation]] within certain bounds. The term linear here is somewhat unfortunate, as it means linear in the compositional sense, not the geometric sense. So by linear we really mean additive, so that more of a cause produces more of an effect, and adding similar causes together produce more of their effects [^1]. In essence it is saying that we can describe the whole as the sum of it's parts.  [[People/Dave Snowden\|Dave Snowden]] even describes a [[complex-system\|complex system]] as one that has no [[linear-causality\|linear causation]]. I would posit that what is happening is that we are examining the system at a scale, either spatial or temporal, in which linear causation no longer applies. Where this breaks down, where the additive causation suddenly turns into something else, is often described as [[emergence\|emergence]]. There is **causal phase change** of sorts, where the whole becomes something more than the sum of it's parts. 

[[Sources/@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a\|@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a]] articulate this well with an example in how traffic behaves at the smaller (individual car) scale, and the larger (flow of traffic) scale:

> For example, in a traffic system the macro-level formation of a traffic jam propagates backwards even though the individual cars at the micro-level general move forward as they speed up or slow down, with some lateral lane changes but rarely do the cars move backwards in traffic. (p. 211)

Unfortunately most of the tools we have are for analysing effects in a linear sense:

> Most mathematical tools commonly used in quantitative research (e.g., differential equations and statistical modeling) are linear tools that work by breaking a system into its components or parts, studying the parts individually, and then adding the parts together to form the whole. However, emergent phenomena in an educational complex system generally have nonlinear properties, which cannot be analyzed by adding up the parts because the patterns at the macro-level of a complex system generally have different properties to the constituent parts at the micro-level of the system. Holland (1995) argues, “Nonlinearities mean that our most useful tools for generalizing observations into theory—trend analysis, determination of equilibria, sample means, and so on are badly blunted” (p. 5).

There are several key aspects of complex systems that pertain to education systems ([[Sources/@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a\|@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a]] where they outline their [[complex-systems-conceptual-framework-for-learning\|complex-systems-conceptual-framework-for-learning]], and expanded on in [[Sources/@jacobsonEducationComplexSystem2019\|@jacobsonEducationComplexSystem2019]]).
