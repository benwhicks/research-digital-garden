Moving through [[dag-space\|dag-space]] without any global sense of direction, only looking at local features - such as neighbouring DAGs with a similar [[adjacency-matrix\|adjacency-matrix]]. This is how many MCMC algorithms move around a space like the [[adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs\|adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs]].
