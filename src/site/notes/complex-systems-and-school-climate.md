[[People/Mel Loveridge\|Mel Loveridge]] reached out when I shared a paper (she works at DoE within the [[school-climate\|school-climate]] unit). Very much into complex systems thinking. Was preferring [[causal-loop-diagrams\|causal-loop-diagrams]] to [[causal-dags\|causal-dags]] due to the latter not really capturing what was important to them. Shared a great paper ( #getref - import school climate paper and link to here) on school climate which takes a nice multi-faceted approach to understanding the system, which certainly leans more into the education system being regarded as a [[complex-system\|complex-system]] in terms of the [[types-of-systems\|types-of-systems]] it falls under.

Happy to potentially run a [[PCM-school-climate\|PCM-school-climate]] session at a later date. This would potentially help understand the [[boundaries-for-appropriate-use-of-DAGs\|boundaries-for-appropriate-use-of-DAGs]]. 

She also mentioned a book - Thinking in Systems or something similar that was a good, but easy, read.
