#resource/tool 

Tool built by [[People/John Kennedy\|John Kennedy]], which he outlined to me at [[lak-25\|lak-25]]. Used for drawing [[causal-loop-diagrams\|Causal Loop Diagram]]s, but works just as well for [[causal-dags\|Causal DAGs]] and other system diagrams. 

## Constraints / assumptions

- It forces the user to place a +/- on everything.
- Signals are always additive
- Timing is dependent on length of nodes

## Some loop models
