#graphical-modelling 
When we think only on the surface of a system we tend to believe certain things are important, but they may not be the key drivers to change. Building [[causal-dags\|causal models]] might help highlight what is actually driving the system in order to affect change. For instance, students' might perceive that they need to see X to help their studies, however other factors might be more indicative of what they need ( #getref I'm sure KK has talked about this)
