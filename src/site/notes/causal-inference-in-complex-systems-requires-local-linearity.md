#thought 
Making a [[causal-claim\|causal claim]] in a [[complex-system\|complex system]] is difficult. We need to assume some kind of [[linear-causality\|linear-causality]] within some bounds, or a locality.   **Note: No references, this is my thought**

[[causality-can-be-opaque-in-complex-systems\|causality-can-be-opaque-in-complex-systems]], [[causal-inference\|causal-inference]]

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmJ89ujITLo) by [[People/Eric Winsberg\|Eric Winsberg]]. Dives into causal inferences made over the pandemic. Is good - certainly pessimistic about making claims using existing techniques, at least until the dust has settled. 

Also, he has [a book](https://www.amazon.com.au/Scientific-Decision-Elements-Philosophy-Science-ebook/dp/B0CY9H899N/ref=sr_1_2?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1cK9vMV1cTLGFD6wUvtD3Ypw3e8dJXAnocbD_trYbpMva41Xtyy3payujr-k8XhZfXJy9MRLOkbyQvqFfpc38A.1ESA-VMpqFFQOzH32MQbg9vnKRHZ-IgJEmTQ8o0r_78&dib_tag=se&qid=1734603689&refinements=p_27%3AEric+Winsberg&s=books&sr=1-2) [[Sources/@winsbergScientificModelsDecision2024\|@winsbergScientificModelsDecision2024]] that is probably a good introduction to the [[philosophy-of-models\|philosophy-of-models]], and a paper on sanctioning the use of models [[Sources/@winsbergSanctioningModelsEpistemology1999\|@winsbergSanctioningModelsEpistemology1999]]. 

It's worth thinking about how [[inference\|inference]] / [[causal-inference\|causal-inference]] in complex systems is made from models. [[modelling-inference\|modelling-inference]] requires a difference view of the [[reference-frame\|reference-frame]] of the system - it is less contingent on the specific data, but rather the [[system-dynamics\|system dynamics]] and how the data is moving. This is akin to using a local frame of reference in a physical system - we do not take into account the motion of the earth or the movement of the sun through the galaxy when analysing the motion of a car around a racetrack, for instance. 

[[linear-causality\|linear-causality]] vs [[non-linear-causality\|non-linear-causality]] - is this the hallmark of moving from complicated to complex systems? There is a test for non-linear (Granger) causality - check the R package NlinTS. [[granger-causality\|granger-causality]]. There are other tests for causality using neural networks - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260722000542
