#thought 
Depending on the level of the complexity of the system (see [[cynefin-framework\|cynefin-framework]] and [[types-of-systems\|types-of-systems]]) it might be necessary to employ a different modelling technique. This is mentioned in Peters (link! - page early on). 
Also mentioned when [[complex-systems-and-school-climate\|complex-systems-and-school-climate]] - she found DAGs unsuitable to what was important in [[school-climate\|school-climate]]. 

Approached might include:

[[causal-dags\|causal-dags]] for simpler systems, or at least 'locally' simple systems that might have a linear causation when solving a particular problem / intervention. 

#todo - add stuff about more complex modelling, such as causal loops and game theory style stuff. Also, is there a layer below DAGs? Where they are not needed in even more simple cases? Perhaps where just counting is fine, for instance?
