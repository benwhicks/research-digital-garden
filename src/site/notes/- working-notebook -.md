# Writing plan

## For [[lak-26\|lak-26]]

[[workshop--causal-modelling-lak-26\|workshop--causal-modelling-lak-26]] materials to prepare, finalise. This includes [[requirements-for-a-causal-modelling-support-tool\|requirements-for-a-causal-modelling-support-tool]] that will be partially built into a new version of [[loopy\|loopy]], which in turn could be a tool report for the [[journal-of-learning-analytics\|Journal of Learning Analytics]] (see below). 

LAK conference: **27 April - 1 May 2026** in Bergen. [[lak-26\|lak-26]]

## For [[aied-26\|aied-26]]

Festival of learning, Korea, is a mix of [[aied-26\|aied-26]], [[edm-26\|edm-26]] and [[l@s-26\|l@s-26]] (could go to any of these, but AIEd call seems appropriate). [AIEd-26 call for papers](https://www.aied-conference.org/2026/call-for-paper)

## [[journal-of-learning-analytics\|JLA]] paper on [[writing--navigating-the-causal-inference-landscape\|Navigating the causal inference landscape]]

This is the "paper 1" in the thesis, outlining the various [[causal-inference\|causal-inference]] methods and setting up the scene for the paper [[Sources/@hicksThinkingCausalModels2022\|@hicksThinkingCausalModels2022]].

# Routines

- 2 x 25 min writing blocks. Could try 5 min editing as a transition activity?
- 1 x 25 min reading / learning block (can be DoE related)
- Leave reference hunting and sorting for the end of the day / downtime. Could even do editing then as well. 


# Other tasks

#todo/read - https://proceedings.mlr.press/v177/ahsan22a/ahsan22a.pdf something on cycles!!


#todo/read settable systems: an extension of pearls causal model with optimisation, equilibrium, and learning. Might be good for ... ??

- [ ] Build list of reading from KK paper recommendation on Bayesian model elicitation. Place in [[elicitation-of-causal-models\|elicitation-of-causal-models]]  
- [ ] Write up review from Bayesian elication
