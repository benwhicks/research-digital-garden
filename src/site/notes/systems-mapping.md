#graphical-modelling 

A process of mapping out the (causal) relationships in a system. Here "mapping" refers to  As it is usually based on expert informed methods, it is likely the same ( #todo check this) as expert-informant modelling, which is outlined as:

> Expert elicited systems modeling is practiced under several different names or labels. These include cross-impact analysis (Godet et al., 1991, 1994; Gordon and Hayward, 1968; Gordon, 1969, 1994; Honton et al., 1984; Huss and Honton, 1987), structural analysis (Godet et al., 1991, 1994; Linss and Fried, 2009, 2010; Panula-Ontto and Piirainen, 2018), morphological analysis (Ritchey, 2006; Weimer-Jehle, 2006), cross-consistency analysis (Johansen, 2018) and Bayesian belief networks and influence diagrams, Bayesian decision support systems, or Bayesian decision support systems (Baran and Jantunen, 2004; Bromley et al., 2005; Ceric, 2016; Cinar and Kayakutlu, 2010; Kristensen and Rasmussen, 2002; Kuikka and Varis, 1997; Laur√≠a and Duchessi, 2006; Leonelli and Smith, 2015). There are several documented modeling approaches and associated computational processes within each mentioned branch of modeling. They have a great deal of conceptual and functional overlap, but also important differences. All approaches (a) utilize expert elicitation (b) in building a model representation of a realworld system or decision-making problem, (c) that can be represented as a graph, nodes as the system descriptors and edges describing their relationships, (d) to be used in analysis of the system, inference or decision support by means of a computational transformation on the model.
