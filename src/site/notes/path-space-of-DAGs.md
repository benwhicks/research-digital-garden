#graphical-modelling 

Each [[causal-dags\|DAG]] in [[dag-space\|dag-space]] is described by it's set of [[causal-paths\|causal-paths]]. 

Does thinking of [[path-space-of-DAGs-is-a-simplicial-complex\|path-space-of-DAGs-is-a-simplicial-complex]] help?

Would moving around this be closer to [[navigating-DAG-space\|navigating-DAG-space]] than [[wandering-around-DAG-space\|wandering-around-DAG-space]]?
