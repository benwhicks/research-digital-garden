A sometimes ill-defined state of a student being engaged with the learning. A more precise model is found with [[affective-learning-state\|affective-learning-state]]s of the student, and when they are [[engaged-flow-affective-learning-state\|engaged-flow-affective-learning-state]]. This is called engaged / flow in [[Sources/@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012\|@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012]] or engaged concentration in [[Sources/@richeyMoreConfusionFrustration2019\|@richeyMoreConfusionFrustration2019]].
