For use in the [[participatory-causal-modelling\|participatory-causal-modelling]] sessions. Allows a small group to be recorded nicely. Needs to be booked through RES Hub email. 

There is a wall monitor that has the two inputs. You need to select the document camera. Get the auto focus on the table then turn the auto focus off. 

Table is actually a white board!!

Options for recording - login as myself then open Kaltura. Might need to set up the two camera's (primary and document) and the audio (Echo cancelling speaker phone). 

once recording is finished copy from desktop shortcut called 'recordings' and move to OneDrive
