#theory/systems 
A [[complex-system\|complex system]] can be complex for different reasons. It might be a challenge of scale, with important interactions happening at a fine granularity that are then observed at a larger scale as [[emergence\|emergent effects]]. These many, small interactions may happen too quickly to be meaningfully observable, such as the many interactions in a classroom between people, but the effect in aggregate is critical. Another way systems might be complex is through layers of feedback, with events happening how affecting what happens in the future at ...

In summary:
- Feedback. This ties in closely with loops in causal diagrams. 
- Interactions. This ties in closes with challenges of effects at different scales. 
- Are there others??

There is good work in [[Sources/@jacobsonEducationComplexSystem2019\|@jacobsonEducationComplexSystem2019]] and [[Sources/@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a\|@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a]] on this. In particular they outline a table of different ways a system can be complex, give a common example, and relate this to examples in education:

This outlines two major [[complex-system\|complex system]] focus areas: [[complex-collective-behaviours-in-a-system\|complex-collective-behaviours-in-a-system]] and [[behaviours-of-individual-agents-in-a-system\|behaviours-of-individual-agents-in-a-system]].

## Modelling

### Moving along the 'interactions' axis
[[Sources/@hammondReasoningCausalityGames2023a\|@hammondReasoningCausalityGames2023a]] approach the modelling of many interactions through a [[game-theory-game\|game theoretic model]]. The transition between a more ordered system and the complex one can be seen in the view of 'no agents' model, in the [[structural-causal-model\|SCM]], the 'one-agent model' in the [[structural-causal-influence-model\|SCIM]], and then the 'multi-agent model' in the [[structural-causal-games\|SCG]].

### Moving along the 'feedback' axis?

Does this move from [[directed-acyclic-graph\|DAG]] to [[causal-loop-diagrams\|CLD]]?
