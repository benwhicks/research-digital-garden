### Who?
The [[context-experts\|non-technical experts]] are people who understand the *context* of the system being modelled, but not necessarily the data or the technical apparatus used to model the system. 

This means, in the process of co-designing causal models, we will need to answer [[RQ1.1. What level of technical expertise do participants have?\|RQ1.1. What level of technical expertise do participants have?]], particularly in relation to graphical causal models. 

These models will be co-designed with a [[data-experts\|data expert]] as well as a [[causal-modelling-facilitator\|causal-modelling-facilitator]]. Individuals may take on multiple roles, or contribute to the three different areas of expertise (between context, data, and causal modelling) in varying degrees.

### What?
The artefact itself will be a [[graphical-causal-model\|GCM]]. This could take on the form of a [[causal-dags\|Causal DAG]], or possibly a [[causal-loop-diagrams\|causal loop diagram]], depending on the system being modelled and the decisions made. 

How **useful** this will be depends on the level of formalisation and detail provided, and what can be done with the model after. To understand this we will need to answer [[RQ1.2. How formalised is the causal model?\|RQ1.2. How formalised is the causal model?]], [[RQ1.3. Is the causal model testable?\|RQ1.3. Is the causal model testable?]], [[RQ1.4. What causal claims can we make with the causal model?\|RQ1.4. What causal claims can we make with the causal model?]], [[RQ1.3 How far would non-technical experts trust the model?\|RQ1.3 How far would non-technical experts trust the model?]], [[RQ1.5. Can the model be used to plan future research?\|RQ1.5. Can the model be used to plan future research?]]
