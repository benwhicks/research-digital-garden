Notes from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-M2U3Jl1Cg) from [[Nicky Case\|Nicky Case]].

- *Show **what** made **you** care*. Don't fall into the trap of trying to convince "why should they" care. 
- *Show **then** tell*. Use **PEA**: **P**ictures, **E**xample, **A**nalogy.
- *"**Therefore, but**" loop*; not "and then" loop. **Therefore** moves conflict/problem to change/solution, and **but** moves the change back to conflict.
- *Write, then cut 10%*
- *Do real tests, early and often*
