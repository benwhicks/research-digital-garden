The data itself is seldom what we actually care about, it is *indicative* of some other *construct* that we think is important. For instance, click-stream data of might show a measure of activity of a student on a learning site, but it is likely what we are actually interested in is if they are engaged in the learning. The click-stream data indicates that a student might be engaged. 

Might be better understood with [[causal-dags\|Causal DAG]]?
