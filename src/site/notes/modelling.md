#theory 

The process of building an abstract representation of the world. This abstract representation of the world we call the [[model\|model]].

https://seop.illc.uva.nl/entries/models-science/ - article from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy


# Why?

Something on Nancy Cartwright's work, beginning 1983. 
False models for a truer theory
[[Sources/@mcelreathMathematicalModelsSocial2008\|@mcelreathMathematicalModelsSocial2008]], Ch1, refers to modelling as the 'theoreticians laboratory'.

# Reading:

Chapter 1 of McElreath. This points to a 1989 paper by ... called False models for a truer theory or something like that. This also points to a 1983 paper by Nancy Cartwright that looks amazing. Would be good to follow up the cited by stuff on this. 

Also, how does this link to work around [[abstract-thinking\|abstract-thinking]], in particular [[thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding\|thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding]].
