Are we helping build priors by transforming the model into a series of stories that are more easy for an expert to interrogate as plausible or not. Is there a way to map between the two?? i.e. sense about the game relationships and stories appearing in the simulation - #read - https://proceedings.mlr.press/v124/hartmann20a/hartmann20a.pdf
