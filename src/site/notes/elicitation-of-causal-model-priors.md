Approach to [[elicitation-of-causal-models\|elicitation-of-causal-models]] in the frame of [[prior-elicitation\|prior-elicitation]] for Bayesian models. This is how [[human-technology-institute\|human-technology-institute]] are approaching incorporating expert knowledge for their [[causal-discovery\|causal discovery]] methods. The aim is to get a distribution of models, ideally a nice spread, that then form a [[prior\|prior]] over the possible [[dag-space\|space of possible DAGs]].
