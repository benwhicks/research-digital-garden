#participatory-modelling

> [!important] Outline
> A list or table of the kind of requirements for making certain edits / prompts in a graphical causal modelling session. For the less technical knowledge ones this could be built into a card-based prompt system. For the more technical requirements a more complex tool, such as software, would be required. The idea is that a designer could use this requirements to build a software tool to support the more technical decisions.

Could also be part of [[technical-democracy\|technical-democracy]] work by [[People/Kalvero Gulson\|Kalvero Gulson]], particularly around there methodology ( #getref - nice website that was part of the pre reading with the GenAI workshop)
