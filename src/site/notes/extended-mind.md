Popularised in *The extended mind: The power of thinking outside the brain*[^1] is the idea that we do not think only within our minds, but rather our tools and communities also form an extended cognitive framework.

The tool I use here to present this is [Obsidian md](https://obsidian.md/), and it's great. I publish to the web using [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/).
