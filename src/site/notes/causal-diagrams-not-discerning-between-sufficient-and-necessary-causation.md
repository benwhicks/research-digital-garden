It seems that a [[graphical-causal-model\|graphical-causal-model]] does not distinguish well between [[sufficient-cause\|sufficient-cause]] and [[necessary-cause\|necessary-cause]]. Typically they lean towards and [[interventional-causality\|interventional-causality]] case - if variable X changes, and X causes Y, then variable Y should change. This seems to fit better as a [[sufficient-cause\|sufficient-cause]]. It becomes harder to articulate [[necessary-cause\|necessary-cause]] in terms of X -> Y, because it may not be the case that changes in X instigate changes in Y, but rather than for Y to change, or perhaps for W -> Y, X must take on certain values. 

Is [[necessary-cause-indicative-of-non-linear-causation\|necessary-cause-indicative-of-non-linear-causation]], as in it indicates more "switching" behaviour rather than linear influence?
