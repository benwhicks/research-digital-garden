#mathematical-modelling/game-theory 
A branch of [[game-theory\|Game Theory]] that analyses evolution as games played betwand within species and their environment. This is a simple way to get a  [[system-dynamics\|System Dynamics]] view of evolution.

A paper on a python package has a nice intro -

> Classical [game theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/game-theory "Learn more about game theory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223004960#bib1) typically analyzes interactions between two (or a few) players and aims to answer how each individual can maximize their utility. Such question, from a mathematical perspective, becomes very intricate and complex as a player must consider the utilities of all other players and any possible set of beliefs. Thus, following the famous work of Nash,[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223004960#bib2) it is often assumed that all players act in a way that maximizes their utility and believe that others will do the same. This simplifies the analysis and transforms it into a search for the points of equilibrium at which no player has any incentive to change its strategy (Nash equilibrium). This assumption requires that players have perfect knowledge about the game/environment and is referred to as rationality. Yet, it is often cumbersome to assume that individuals are rational in many social and biological systems, even in simple pairwise interactions. Moreover, whenever the problem requires a proper understanding of conflicts occurring in large populations, it becomes necessary to characterize the choices and strategies of many individuals throughout time, and not only at equilibrium. As such, in many real-world scenarios where [game theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/game-theory "Learn more about game theory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is applied, the goal is shifted toward the understanding of the complex ecologies of behaviors emerging from a given dilemma (or ”game”). This is where [evolutionary game theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/evolutionary-game-theory "Learn more about evolutionary game theory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (EGT) shines as a theoretical and computational framework.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223004960#bib3),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223004960#bib4)
> In EGT, the individual payoffs collected through strategic interactions in a given game are associated with a personal fitness. In a biological setting, the fittest individuals are more likely to produce [offspring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/child "Learn more about offspring from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), thus, passing on their traits to the next generation. Hence, fitness has a direct interpretation in terms of relative death and birth rates. When applying this evolutionary concept to social systems, the most successful are more likely to be imitated. As a result, their strategies will have higher chances of being adopted by other members of the population in subsequent generations. Fitness therefore encodes a measure of social success. Overall, EGT allows for a convenient (formal and dynamical) similarity between social learning and Darwinian evolution, further broadening the spectrum of possible applications of evolutionary games.
