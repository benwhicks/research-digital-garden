[[Sources/@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a\|@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a]] outline the Complex Systems Conceptual Framework for Learning (CSCFL)  for viewing [[learning-is-complex\|learning]] through a [[complex-system\|complex system]] lens. There are two focus areas of the CSCFL: *collective behaviours of a system* and *behaviours of individual agents in a system*. Although there has been work in education around the first, collective behaviour, focus there has been little work in the second focus area on individual agent behaviour.

> Our reading of the complex systems and education literature is that, in general, the conceptual perspectives in the CSCFL focus area complex collective behaviors of a system, such as nonlinearity and emergence, have been emphasized. However, conceptual perspectives in the focus area behaviors of individual agents in a system have received less attention, even though educational systems, in common with complex systems, “involve many components that adapt or learn as they interact” (Holland, 2006, p. 1).

### Collective behaviours of a system
- (a) [[interactions-between-agents\|interactions of individual agents]] or components of the system that often may be described in terms of simple rules; 
- (b) [[causal-loops\|feedback interactions]] between agents that may occur within or across system levels; 
- (c) [[self-organisation\|self-organisation]] of agents in a system that typically result from the two previous conceptual perspectives; 
- (d) [[sensitivity-to-initial-conditions\|sensitivity to initial conditions]] or chaos, where there is an amplification of initial state differences in a system (often based on positive feedback interactions) that may contribute to major behavioural changes in a system; and 
- (e) [[emergence\|emergence]], regarded by many scientists as the most important complexity construct (Bar-Yam, 2003; Gell-Mann, 1994; Holland, 2006; Kauffman, 1995; Mitchell, 2009).

### Behaviours of individual agents in a system

> \[Holland (2006)\] proposes several important characteristics of how individual elements or agents behave, of which three are currently included in the CSCFL as being the most relevant for educational systems: (a) parallelism, (b) conditional actions, and (c) adaptation and evolution.

- (a) [[parallelism\|parallelism]] is exhibited when agents in a complex system have simultaneous interactions with each other by sending and receiving signals. For example, students on a playground will be doing a variety of things simultaneously while talking and listening to each other (sending and receiving signals), some riding a swing or perhaps pushing a friend, others throwing a ball back and forth, playing hopscotch, and so on.
- (b) [[conditional-actions\|conditional actions]] are how an agent might respond to received signals, often described with rules such as IF a certain signal is received, THEN act in a certain way. For example, if a soccer ball is close to a player (i.e., an agent in the system), then they would try to kick it, unless IF the player is the goal keeper THEN they would try to catch or deflect the ball. An important characteristic of complex systems is that the combination of relatively simple agent rules, and the parallelism of many agents simultaneously acting based on these rules, can result in very complex and dynamically changing behaviors.
- (c) [[adaptation-and-evolution\|adaptation and evolution]] is a particularly important conceptual perspective in complex systems, of relevance to educational systems in that the agents themselves change over time; that is, they learn. For example, students in a classroom may be regarded as agents in an educational complex system who, at a given time, have certain internal cognitive structures and affective knowledge related to a subject, and who, over time at school, will (hopefully) construct (i.e., evolve) new or modified cognitive structures from their learning activities.

### Completeness

> we note that Jacobson et al. (2016) do not claim that the CSCFL’s currently included complexity conceptual perspectives are exhaustive. There are, of course, many, many more complexity concepts—such as autocatalytic systems (Kauffman, 1995), activation and inhibition (Bar-Yam, 2003), bifurcations (Mitchell, 2009), and so on—that can also have relevance for understanding various aspects of education as a complex system. Still, we believe the CSCFL includes a reasonable core of complexity conceptual perspectives relevant to educational and learning systems, and that these can be useful analytical tools for education researchers.
