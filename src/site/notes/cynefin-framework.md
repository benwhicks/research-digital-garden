#theory/systems 
A [framework](https://thecynefin.co/about-us/about-cynefin-framework/) developed by Dave Snowden and his team. 

#getref David J Snowden and Mary E Boone. 2007. A leaderâ€™s framework for decision making. Harvard business review 85, 11 (2007), 68.

### Types of systems
Describes systems as being a [[simple-system\|simple-system]] (or clear system, in the diagram below), a [[complicated-system\|complicated-system]], a [[complex-system\|complex-system]] or a [[chaotic-system\|chaotic-system]]. Depending on the types of systems we should think about understanding them and intervening in them in different ways, which implies they think that [[causal-structure-is-qualitatively-different-in-different-systems\|causal-structure-is-qualitatively-different-in-different-systems]].

### Transition between system states
The framework considers that systems may not stay in any one state (simple, complicated, complex or chaotic). #todo this might need some thought about how it relates to graphical causal modelling.
