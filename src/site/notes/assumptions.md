A defined thing that we believe to be true. Typically this is not based on data but often based on some theory of the world or experience. An assumption often has a purpose, often to help provide the [[warrant-of-a-causal-claim\|warrant-of-a-causal-claim]]. They can also be [[explicit-assumptions\|explicit-assumptions]] that are defined and transparent, or [[implicit-assumptions\|implicit-assumptions]] that might be inferred by the [[warrant-of-a-causal-claim\|warrant-of-a-causal-claim]] used or the [[causal-claim\|causal-claim]]s themselves.

In [[machine-learning\|machine-learning]] this is sometimes referred to as [[assumptions\|inductive-bias]] instead, but this means the same thing (chapter 1 of Causal AI by Robert Ness), specifically the implicit assumptions in an ML algorithm. It is curious that they wanted a different term to use here - [[was-inductive-bias-language-chosen-to-avoid-assumption-language\|was-inductive-bias-language-chosen-to-avoid-assumption-language]]?
