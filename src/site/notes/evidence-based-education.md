The (widespread, #getref) push for evidence-based or evidence-informed practice in education. This is an attitude that is inherited from the [[evidence-based-medicine\|evidence-based-medicine]] movement, and leans heavily into [[randomised-control-trial\|RCTs]] as the primary form of evidence ( #getref ). 


## Support

#todo get examples, what works clearing house, AERO, Hattie, etc...

## Criticism
As yet, however, it is yet to yield promising results ( #getref - see the grant appllication https://studentutsedu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/kirsty_kitto_uts_edu_au/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7170494E-66DF-4ABE-B15B-55FDEF978AD5%7D&file=C1_DPEI25-EdExpertsInControl%201.docx&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.p2p_ns.rwc&action=default&mobileredirect=true). 

Part of this may be due to [[important-aspects-of-learning-may-never-be-in-the-evidence-base\|important-aspects-of-learning-may-never-be-in-the-evidence-base]], such as creativity or curiosity, or longer term effects.
