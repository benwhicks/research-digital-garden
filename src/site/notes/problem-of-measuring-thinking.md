How do we measure how our thinking is evolving? What kind of traces might be useful?

Ideas:
* Utilising surprise metrics in the text: [[surprise-might-be-a-way-to-measure-improved-thinking\|surprise-might-be-a-way-to-measure-improved-thinking]]
* Evolving metrics on the DAGs, so that [[graph-metrics-might-show-model-development-traces\|graph-metrics-might-show-model-development-traces]]
* Evolving movement through the [[dag-space\|space of possible DAGs]], possibly leveraging if a [[path-space-better-articulates-a-causal-view-of-DAGs\|path-space-better-articulates-a-causal-view-of-DAGs]].
