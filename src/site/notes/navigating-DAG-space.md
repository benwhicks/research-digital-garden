#graphical-modelling 

Moving around the [[dag-space\|space of possible DAGs]] with a sense of the global landscape as well as the local. Might be possible with a more structured way of looking at [[dag-space\|dag-space]] such as viewing the [[path-space-of-DAGs-is-a-simplicial-complex\|path-space-of-DAGs-is-a-simplicial-complex]].
