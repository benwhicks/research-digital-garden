#graphical-modelling 

The 'space' of [[causal-dags\|causal-dags]]. This is not well defined. A typical way is to define the DAG in terms of it's [[adjacency-matrix\|adjacency-matrix]], leading to navigating the [[adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs\|adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs]]. Another way is to think of the DAGs as a collection of [[causal-paths\|causal-paths]], generating a [[path-space-of-DAGs\|path-space-of-DAGs]]. There seems to be no canonical way to do this, however it is worth considering the affordances of different perspectives on the space of possible DAGs in terms of how they relate to the [[structural-implications-of-a-DAG\|structural-implications-of-a-DAG]]. Two neighbouring DAGs in terms of adjacency matrices may have quite different causal implications to two neighbouring DAGs in the path space, and it's possible that [[path-space-better-articulates-a-causal-view-of-DAGs\|path-space-better-articulates-a-causal-view-of-DAGs]].
