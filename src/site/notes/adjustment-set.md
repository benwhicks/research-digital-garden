#graphical-modelling 
A set of variables implied by a [[causal-dags\|Causal DAG]] that enable an [[unbiased-causal-effect\|unbiased-causal-effect]] estimate from [[observational-data\|observational-data]]. They are typically used as controls in a regression model. 

However, the adjustment set is a more general statement about [[conditional-probabilities\|conditional-probabilities]] and can be viewed as more than that. In fact [[adjustment-sets-offer-a-generalisable-ideal-perspective-on-data\|adjustment-sets-offer-a-generalisable-ideal-perspective-on-data]].
