#graphical-modelling 

A graph, using nodes to represent variables, and directed edges to represent the flow of causation, to help model a system. 

These can be in the form of [[causal-dags\|causal-dags]] for systems that involve no loops, or [[causal-loop-diagrams\|causal-loop-diagrams]] for those that do, but there are a whole range of possible system maps of this form [[Sources/@barbrook-johnsonParticipatorySystemsMapping2022\|@barbrook-johnsonParticipatorySystemsMapping2022]]. 

# Taxonomy of system maps / GCMs

[[Sources/@barbrook-johnsonParticipatorySystemsMapping2022\|@barbrook-johnsonParticipatorySystemsMapping2022]] outlines the following:
- [[causal-loop-diagrams\|CLD]]: Causal Loop Diagrams
- [[fuzzy-cognitive-map\|fuzzy-cognitive-map]]s
- [[theory-of-change-maps\|theory-of-change-maps]]
- Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), which are [[causal-dags\|causal-dags]] 
- [[system-dynamics\|system-dynamics]] section which they use for [[system-dynamics\|Stock and flow diagrams]]

#todo model the structure of GCM, etc. Level below GCM is DAG, CLD, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, etc. Level below is their components / allowed properties, such as [[fuzzy-edges\|fuzzy-edges]], [[functional-edges\|functional-edges]], [[causal-loops\|causal-loops]] / feedback, [[signed-edges\|signed-edges]]. It may also be useful to link this in with other structural models, such as [[structural-causal-model\|structural-causal-model]]s and [[structural-equation-model\|structural-equation-model]]s.
