Open Learner Models (OLMs) are models of a learner designed to persist over their lifetime, that also permit the learner to scruitinise the model through an interface [[Sources/@kayLifelongLearnerModeling2008\|@kayLifelongLearnerModeling2008]]. The aim of an OLM is to permit a greater synergy between how the learner learns, and how the various learning systems reason about the learner.
