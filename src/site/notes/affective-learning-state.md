The emotional state that someone is in when learning. 

# Discrete models

The various learning states described in [[Sources/@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012\|@dmelloDynamicsAffectiveStates2012]]:
- [[engaged-flow-affective-learning-state\|engaged-flow-affective-learning-state]]
- [[confusion-affective-learning-state\|confusion-affective-learning-state]]
- [[frustration-affective-learning-state\|frustration-affective-learning-state]]
- [[boredom-affective-learning-state\|boredom-affective-learning-state]]

Later Liu et al., 2013 also define
- [[confrustion-affective-learning-state\|confrustion-affective-learning-state]] as a single state with a spectrum between [[confusion-affective-learning-state\|confusion]] and [[frustration-affective-learning-state\|frustration]]


# Valence and activation model

> In learning contexts, affect has been operationalized in terms of the dimensions of emotional valence and activation (Pekrun et al., [2002](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0057)). In the affective circumplex (Russell & Barrett, [1999](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0067)), _valence_ separates positive affect from negative, and _activation_ refers to the extent of physiological arousal caused by an affect (Ben-Eliyahu & Linnenbrink-Garcia, [2013](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0012); Boekaerts & Pekrun, [2016](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0013)). During a learning situation, a student may feel _positively activated_ (e.g., enjoyment), _negatively activated_ (e.g., anxiety), _positively deactivated_ (e.g., relief) or _negatively deactivated_ (e.g., boredom) (Pekrun, [2016](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0056)). Rather than seeking to detect distinct emotions, this study specifies varying _affective states_ during learning in terms of valence and activation. Affective states, including emotions, can be defined as situation-specific responses to the changing environment (Rosenberg, [1998](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525#bjep12525-bib-0075)).
