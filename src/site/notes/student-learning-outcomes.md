> The analysis revealed four main learning outcome indicators: (1) academic achievement, which includes an exploration of whether the use of LADs has a discernible effect on student’s academic performance, including their grades, assessment scores, and overall performance in educational contexts; (2) motivation, which focuses on LADs potential to bolster students’ motivation to learn; (3) participation including active involvement in classroom discussions, group projects, and other activities, and, (4) attitudes toward learning, such as self-efficacy and anxiety.
