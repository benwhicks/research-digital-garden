> The literature on causality is controversial (Baumgartner, 2008), and the discussion often relate back to the work of David Hume in the 18th Century, and from him came regularity theories of causation, much of which arose from reflections on physical properties in the world. His view of causality begins with the empirical, arguing that understanding causal relationships was beyond a purely deductive approach but rather based on experience (Tacq, 2011). A Humean premise of regularity theory is that an effect invariably follows the cause, and so cause and effect are determined not from one instance of observation, but from many instances that confirm the relationship (Hume, 1786; Hitchcock, 2012). In this view, the invariable pattern of cause and effect is called _constant conjunction_ where the cause occurs chronologically before the effect and inference is based on repeated observations (Hume, 1786; Tacq, 2011). The main idea here is that repeated observations (experience) of cause then effect create causal inference and demonstrate regularity; however, humans make-meaning from even one instance. For example, a person touching a hot stove does not need to repeatedly experiment to infer cause as a functional matter. Thus, philosophical and functional facets of causality may diverge in practice.
> Regularity theory of causation reflects the pre-theoretic intuitions of causal relations in existential logic (Baumgartner, 2008) and it involves the principle of asymmetry. Asymmetry assumes that causation has directionality or “it does not follow from ‘x caused y’ that ‘y caused x’, for there is a fundamental distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’” (Dowe, 1992, p. 179). There are, however, problems with regularity theory of causation. The researcher’s point of observation will affect how causal relations are theorized, and working with causality is a process of encirclement (Tacq, 2011) rather than solely through direct observation.
> One significant problem with regularity theory is imperfect regularities or effects that do not always follow a cause (Hitchcock, 2012). Hitchcock (2012) suggested that a heterogeneity of circumstances can affect causality. He uses the example of smoking and lung cancer. Smoking is a cause of lung cancer, but the effect is not immediate (one cigarette does not cause instant cancer) and not all smokers develop lung cancer, due possibly to genetic predispositions. Smokers and non-smokers alike may be exposed to other carcinogens that cause lung cancer. He also identified problems with irrelevance – that is, an event that is always followed by an outcome may still be irrelevant to causing that outcome. With regard to asymmetry, regularity theory does not provide directionality of causation. Similarly, there may be spurious regularities, such as a drop in mercury on a barometer, which observed first, may be thought to cause a storm, which is observed afterward. Additionally, effects are not always discrete and finished. In the flow of human history, causes may continue to reach forward in time with many different effects.
> Given problems with regularity theory, probabilistic theories of causation center upon the idea that causes alter the probability of an effect while still allowing that an effect may occur without the cause or they may fail to manifest altogether (Hitchcock, 2012). Basic logic statements of probabilistic causation include (a) the probability of x cause must be greater than zero, (b) x cause occurs prior to y effect, (c) a statistically relationship exists between x cause and y effect, (d) the statistical relationship is not spurious and it remains when controlling for confounding factors (Tacq, 2011, p. 267) and control of spuriousness depends upon the theoretical relationship between variables or causal modeling (Hitchcock, 2012).


Causation can be singular causation or general causation:

> Causation can be singular causation or general causation (Baumgartner, 2008; Hitchcock, 2012). Baumgartner (2008) provided examples of the two; general causation is found in the statement that alcohol causes drunkenness whereas singular causation is found in the statement that drinking alcohol in the afternoon caused a person to become drunk that particular day.
