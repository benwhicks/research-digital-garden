Association between two variables in when the change in the value of one variable means you are more likely to observe a change in the other variable. In some sense they share 'information' between each other. Variables that are not associated are independent. In practice, this is not a yes / no proposition, it is more common that variables exhibit a certain degree of association. This begs the question - are they linked in some "physical" way? Are they connected in the underlying system?

==Correlation== is often used in place of the word association, however this describes a specific type of association between numeric variables.  It is often remarked that "Correlation is not Causation". However there are other sayings, such as "no correlation without causation" 
- [ ] #todo - check these sayings and get proper references / links - they come up a bit.
