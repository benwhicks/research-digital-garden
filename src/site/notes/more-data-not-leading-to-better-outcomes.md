More data has not led to consistently better educational outcomes, and there is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of many EdTech tools, often despite substantial investment in various evaluation programs:  

“out of 10,654 studies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in mid-April, only 188—less than 2 percent—concluded that a product had strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness.” (García et al., 2020)

This issue has led to calls for evidence standards in Australian education (Loble and Hawcroft, 2022), but decades of effort in using controlled experiments has often led to inconclusive results (Thomas, 2021), and claims that “The research we have is not the research we need” (Reeves and Lin, 2020). How can we work towards a more effective use of data to generate evidence in education?
