#thought 
there is an argument for not needing to understand how [[artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]] works to be an expert user. However I’d say that one does need to know enough about the underlying theory of [[artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]]. This is akin to not needing to know how a car works to drive one, but you do need to have a basic understanding of the underlying laws of physics to drive one safely. Fortunately you can learn that tacitly from our interactions with the world, not just in the classroom, however it is less clear how that kind of tacit knowledge may arise for AI. This then begs the question, [[what is a minimal theoretical curriculum for the ai age\|what is a minimal theoretical curriculum for the ai age]]?
