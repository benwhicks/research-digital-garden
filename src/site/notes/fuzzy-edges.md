#graphical-modelling 

Weighted edges in a graph. In a [[fuzzy-cognitive-map\|fuzzy-cognitive-map]] these are often indicated by shading. They have analogies with an [[adjacency-matrix\|adjacency-matrix]] whose entries take any value in the interval $[0,1]$ rather than taking values from the set $\{0,1\}$. It also has analogies to choosing a potential prior distribution for the parameters in a causal model.
