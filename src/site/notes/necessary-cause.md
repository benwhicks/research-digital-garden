#theory/causation 
A type of [[causality\|causation]] where X -n-> Y means that for Y to happen then X must also occur. For example watering a plant is a necessary cause for it to grow, but it is not [[sufficient-cause\|sufficient]]. It would not matter how much you water a plant that is kept in a cupboard wrapped in a blanket, because the watering of the plant is not a [[sufficient-cause\|sufficient cause]] for it to grow.

This is also used in legal arguments frequently [@macagnoArgumentationSchemes2018, p. 166] as the "but-for" clause in tort law (referencing Wright 1985: Causation in tort law). 
They adopt the "following analysis of the causal relation (Kienpointner, 2002, p.1; Perelmen on causal arguments)":

1. B regularly follows A
2. A occurs earlier than (or the same time as) B
3. A is changeable / could be changed
4. If A did not occur, B would not occur ([[ceteris paribus\|ceteris paribus]])

It is the last point that indicates this is a version of necessary cause.

# Problems

Just because something is *not* a necessary cause does not mean it did not contribute to causing something to happen. Suppose a student is learning from their teacher as well as a tutor. Both are contributing (i.e. causing) to the student learning, but neither are necessary causes because they fail the "but-for" test - if either one did not happen, then the other would have (probably) been sufficient for the student to learn.
