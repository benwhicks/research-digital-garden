The *tragedy of the commons*, first introduced by Hardin (1968), is a concept  that describes the uncooperative phenomena of free loading individuals within a group working towards common resources. The free loading individuals maximise their own utility at the expense of conserving resources for the benefit of the group. This leads to a tension between central control and voluntary cooperation which can result in overuse of resources (Ostrom, 2008).

This scenario is often analysed using [[game-theory\|game-theory]].

Actually the concept is originally from Hardin (1968) and may not be to do with game theory, at least originally. 

This obviously has applications in learning, particular where we want to students to work together - such as on group assignments.

> A free riding behaviour could arise where some participants will try to take advantage of the group and request help from the other participants while ignoring requests of others, even though this might not be done intentionally. Such a situation is referred to as _tragedy of the commons_ (Ostrom, 2008).
