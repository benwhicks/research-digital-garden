Relates to [[intangible-data\|intangible-data]] and [[theories-of-learning\|theories of learning]]

Without being exhaustive of the considerable work in this area, it is useful to consider the challenges outlined by \citet{kayLearningTheories1012016} for five major learning theories: Behaviourism, Social cognitive theory, Cognitive learning theory, Constructivism, and Social constructivism. 
This exercise exposes several reasons why learning is challenging to measure and analyse. 

THE DATA THAT WE NEED???

% \subsubsection{Option1: Table}
% Table \ref{tab:learning_theories} highlights three problems from the perspective of major theories of learning: the fine \textbf{granularity} of important events, the reliance on numerous \textbf{interactions} between people and their environment, and the hidden \textbf{cognitive} processes. 

% \begin{table}[]
%     \centering
%     \begin{tabular}{r  p{2.5in}  p{2in}}
%     \toprule
%          Learning theory & Sample principals \cite{kayLearningTheories1012016} relating to observation challenges & Observation challenges \\
%     \midrule
%          \textit{Behaviourism} & 
%          Behaviour is understood on the relationship between stimulus and response...focus is purely on observable behaviours. &  
%          \textbf{Granularity} of the \textbf{interaction} between stimulus and response - can be a challenge when rapid, such as a classroom dialogue. \\
%          \textit{Social cognitive theory} & 
%          Learner doesn't have to be directly reinforced in order to demonstrate behaviour...they might see or hear what happened when someone else demonstrated the behaviour. Can be expanded to include learners self-efficacy and self-regulation. & 
%          \textbf{Interactions} between the observing student and other behaviours. \textbf{Cognitive} processes surrounding self-efficacy and self-regulation. \\
%          \textit{Cognitive learning theory} & 
%          Individuals form mental representations of lived experiences (information, knowledge, episodes, relationships, and interactions) & Students' \textbf{cognitive} process. Relationship and \textbf{interaction} experiences. \\
%          \textit{Constructivism} & 
%          Learners construct new knowledge as they observe and interact with their environment. Knowledge and skills are developed due to frequent interactions and opportunities to experiment, organize concepts, make meaning. & 
%          \textbf{Granularity} of \textbf{interactions} with environment. Internal \textbf{cognitive} process of meaning making. \\
%          \textit{Social constructivism} & 
%          All learning is socially mediated. Learners develop knowledge by their interactions with the people, tools, signs, symbols and language in their environment. &  
%          \textbf{Granularity} of numerous \textbf{interactions} with both other people and environment. \textbf{Cognitive} internalization of knowledge. \\
%          \bottomrule
%     \end{tabular}
%     \caption{The challenges of observer the key aspects of major learning theories. Three categories of observation challenges are highlighted: \textbf{granularity}, \textbf{cognition} and \textbf{interactions}.}
%     \label{tab:learning_theories}
% \end{table}

% When viewed collectively these theories of learning highlight the importance of processes, both cognitive and social, that rely on numerous interactions between learners and their environment.
