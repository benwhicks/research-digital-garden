#theory/causation 
Describing the [[causality\|causal]] effect between two variables. The literature from epidemiology often adds "treatment" before the word effect because it is centred around the effect of a treatment. 


Can be split into (albeit with fuzzy boundaries):
- [[average-effects\|average-effects]] for overall effects. Typically these are [[homogenous-effects\|homogenous-effects]]. 
- [[conditional-effects\|conditional-effects]] for the average effect within a group, used to address [[heterogenous-effects\|heterogenous-effects]].
- [[individual-effects\|individual-effects]] for the effect on an individual

Should detail these more in [[taxonomy-of-causal-effects\|taxonomy-of-causal-effects]]
