The constraints on a DAG closely align with moving from a [[proto-theory\|proto-theory]] as defined in [[theory-construction-methodology\|theory-construction-methodology]] to a [[formal-model\|formal-model]]. A DAG is simulable - it defines the [[Data Generating Process\|Data Generating Process]] and so can be used to "push forward" random noise or prior distributions to generate fake data. This process of simulating data is part of the [[TCM\|TCM]] frameworks approaches to testing a theory - can the [[formal-model\|formal theory]] replicate the real world [[phenomena\|phenomena]] it is trying to explain?
