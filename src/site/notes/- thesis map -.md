# Research Questions

I aim to answer the following questions:
### [[RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?\|RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?]]

### [[RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?\|RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?]]


## Core beliefs
Embedded in this are some of my underlying biases / hypotheses
### [[there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality\|there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality]] 
### [[thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding\|thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding]]
### [[thinking-abstractly-is-accessible\|thinking-abstractly-is-accessible]]


# Plan

Thesis by compilation. [[uts-guidelines-for-thesis-by-compilation\|uts-guidelines-for-thesis-by-compilation]]

==Highlighted== are first author.

### In compilation, whole

- Philosophical paper: [[causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity\|causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity]]
- LAK22: ==Thinking with causal models== [[Sources/@hicksThinkingCausalModels2022\|@hicksThinkingCausalModels2022]]
- ==Collaborative Causal Modelling== workshop, ALASI24. #getref 
- [[participatory-causal-modelling\|PCM]] paper(s)
- LAK25: ==EGT for intangible data== #getref 
- Optional: Further modelling paper

#### In compilation, as related work.

- ASCILITE21: ==Opportunities to improve learning analytics for student support when using online assessment tools==, [url](https://publications.ascilite.org/index.php/APUB/article/view/353/328). Regression model without causal model, but highlights the confounding as a limitation and points to Lubke as a case of what might need to b e done. 
- JLA commentary: ==Learning outcomes and learning interventions==, I'm first on this subsection, but not on the whole peer commentary, which is how it is cited. [url](https://oro.open.ac.uk/92113/) [[Sources/@fergusonAligningGoalsLearning2023\|@fergusonAligningGoalsLearning2023]].

- Belonging lit model ALASI24 #getref

#### Other papers, not related to work but in the field of Ed.




## Structure

Notes from phd meet:
1. Learning is complex. Multiple representations, 
2. Inference in complex systems

### Learning is complex / justification / gap

> Needs to introduce the research study and justify how it adds to knowledge in the field

A section that refers to some work that I have done examining learning as a complex system. This would not be papers in full (none are first author) but would include key parts and reflection, perhaps. 

Might lead into literature review?

### Review

> A review of the literature, or a paper that reviews the literature

Would be an amalgamation of lit review sections from all papers. 

### Approach

> A chapter or paper(s) that describe and justify the research approach and methods




- EDM25, but the JEDM track version. 



# Writing plan

## Philosophical paper

Philosophy of Science?? How about [[causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity\|causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity]], and getting into the idea of local linear causation. Emergence is key here but also just levels of abstraction and where we have visibility. 
#todo/read Causation: A very short introduction (on Kindle)
#todo/read Scale (on Kindle)
#todo/read Philosophy of models book (on Kindle)

## Navigating the causal inference landscape

Maybe still include this one? Do this instead of philosophical one?

What are we trying to do when we do statistical modelling in education? 

## [[participatory-causal-modelling\|PCM]] paper(s), applications in Ed
