#theory/systems 

There are different kinds of system, and how we understand them is different. The [[cynefin-framework\|cynefin-framework]] presents one way of understanding them in terms of their complexity. Broadly speaking most agree there is a difference between a [[complex-system\|complex-system]] and either a [[simple-system\|simple-system]] or even [[complicated-system\|complicated-system]]. 

The most careful distinction seems to be between complicated and complex systems. A [[complicated-system\|complicated system]] might be difficult to understand, but it can be analysed in parts and understood that way. If we remove one component of a complicated system it tends to not perform as well as a whole, and conversely if you optimise one component of a complicated system it tends to perform better as a whole. A [[complex-system\|complex system]] might be difficult to understand, and we can gain some insight from analysing it's parts, however there is behaviour in the complex system that [[emergence\|emerges]] from the interaction of it's parts. If we remove one component of a complex system it tends to adapt (if it is a [[complex-adaptive-system\|complex-adaptive-system]]), and if we optimise one component of a complex system it might improve things but [[optimising-in-complex-systems-can-cause-failure\|optimising-in-complex-systems-can-cause-failure]] as well.

# Taxonomy of systems

Systems can be classified in numerous ways, sometimes according to their complexity (from the [[cynefin-framework\|Cynefin framework]]):
- [[simple-system\|simple-system]]
- [[complicated-system\|complicated-system]]
- [[complex-system\|complex-system]]
- [[chaotic-system\|chaotic-system]]

But other times in times it might be in terms of the domain:
- [[education-system\|education-system]]
- etc...
