#thought 
For (solving one of these problems - [[theory-context-data-gap\|theory-context-data-gap]], [[closing-the-gap-interventions-not-fitting-context\|closing-the-gap-interventions-not-fitting-context]]) we need a more cohesive understanding between how we understand the problem and how we understand the data. This requires that those who have knowledge of the problem at hand and the real world mechanisms of the system (the *[[domain-experts\|context experts]]*) are able to communicate their knowledge to those that understand and build the statistical machinery to interpret the data used to inform decisions (the *[[data-experts\|data experts]]*).


# How?

One such way is to get [[domain-experts\|context experts]] and [[data-experts\|data experts]] speaking a [[shared-language-between-context-and-data\|shared-language-between-context-and-data]], such as a [[graphical-causal-model\|Systems Map]].
