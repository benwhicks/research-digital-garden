> The ‘gold standard’ of research has been experimental design (Anderson & Scott, 2012; Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart & Lalive, 2010; Donmoyer, 2012; Eisenhart, 2005; Goertz & Mahoney, 2012), because it capitalizes on manipulable causes (Shadish, 2010). Experimental design never proves causality in an absolute sense, but rather provides degrees of confidence through statistical methods that assess probabilities of relationships and prevailing explanations (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Certainly, experimental studies are critical for clinical trials where lives are at stake, but they are expensive, time consuming (Gortler, 2015), and possibly unethical if one provides participants – including learners in a course – unequal standards of training or care. There are also logical problems with applying case and effect in the natural world to closely to social phenomena. For example, two people could react very different to the same event.
> Finding plausible alternatives is important for experimental research when developing models of assumptions and reducing threats to internal validity (Maxwell, 2013; Russ-Eft & Hoover, 2005; Shadish, 2010) and one way to handle this threat is to intentionally collect data on competing causal claims, which may falsify hypotheses (Popper, 1959; Shadish, 2010). Shadish (2010) recognized that Hume’s theory of causation created _counterfactuals_ – that is, logic statements that reflect if a cause did not occur then a given effect would not be manifest or other effects may be present in the absence of the given causal hypothesis – and he confirmed that the boundary between various types of validity is artificial, including the aforementioned internal validity, as well as external validity, which is the concept of whether a cause and effect relationship can be generalized elsewhere, and construct validity of inferences between the study design and the theoretical constructs that the study was meant to measure.
