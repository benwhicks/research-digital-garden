#graphical-modelling 
A square matrix that indicates edges of a graph. If $A_{ij}=1$ then there is an edge from node $i$ to node $j$ (or sometimes they are also defined the other way around - it seems to differ in different fields so is important to define it). If $A_{ij}=0$ then there is no edge from node $i$ to node $j$. A value between 0 and 1 can be used to indicate the probability of an edge existing - a [[fuzzy-edges\|fuzzy edge]].
