> [!info] [UTS guidelines](https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/2024-02/grs-graduate-research-candidature-management-thesis-preparation-and-submission-procedures.pdf) on Thesis by Compilation
> **Thesis by compilation** 
> A thesis by compilation is structured as a single manuscript that comprises a combination of chapters and published/publishable works (i.e., papers). 
> 
> There is no prescription about the specific structure of chapters or number of papers to be included in a thesis by compilation. Overall, the quantity and quality of the material presented for examination needs to equate to that which would otherwise be presented in the conventional thesis format in the relevant discipline. 
> 
> The thesis must present each chapter/paper in a logical and coherent way and may require the addition of linking text to establish the relationship between one chapter/paper and the next. This could, for example, be achieved by the inclusion of a preamble to each chapter. 
> 
> In general, a thesis by compilation should include: 
> - An introduction to the research study and a justification of how it adds to knowledge in the field; 
> - A chapter reviewing literature or literature review paper; 
> - A chapter or paper(s) that describe and justify the research approach and methods; 
> - Chapters and/or papers that present results; 
> - A discussion and conclusion. 
> 
> Each paper included in the thesis should be distinct. While there may be some overlap, each paper should be substantially different in focus or content. A thesis by compilation must include a declaration that specifies: 
> - Title, authorship and publication outlet of each paper; 
> - The current status of each paper (in press, accepted, submitted/under review); 
> - The extent of the contribution of the graduate research student and other authors to the research and the authorship of each paper; 
> - The signature of the graduate research student and all other authors (in the case of co-authored paper(s)).
>
>   **11.2.Reasons for inclusion of publications in the thesis** 
>   
>   Reasons for inclusion of publications in the thesis may be: 
>   1. Provides evidence of published output during candidature; and 
>   2. Contributes to the arguments in studentâ€™s thesis. 
>   
>   **11.3. Types of publications** 
>   
>   A thesis may include journal articles, conference papers, or book chapters. 
>   
>   **11.4. Conditions for inclusion of publications in thesis** 
>   
>   The included publications must be original work arising from research by the graduate research student during their candidature, that is, as part of their dissertation project. The included publications must contribute to the argument of the thesis. 
>   
>   In a conventional thesis or thesis by compilation format, included works must be either: 
>   - Submitted for publication (i.e., under review); 
>   - Accepted for publication; 
>   - Published. 
>   
>   In a Thesis by Publication format, included works must be published. 
>   1. Students are required to obtain written permission from the copyright owners if their publications are under copyright or restriction. 
>   2. Graduate research students are required to indicate clearly the contributions of each author in any joint publications. 
>   3. For inclusion of publications in the thesis the graduate research student must be either the first author or have made substantial contributions (50% or more) to the publication.
>   4.
