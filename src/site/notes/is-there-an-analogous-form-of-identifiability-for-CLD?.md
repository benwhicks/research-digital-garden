#graphical-modelling 

In [[causal-loop-diagrams\|causal-loop-diagrams]] is there something similar to [[identifiable\|identifiability]] in [[causal-dags\|causal-dags]]? That is, is there a structural feature of a [[causal-loop-diagrams\|CLD]] that enables it useful from a causal perspective, and if so is it able to be seen in the diagram in some way?
