#theory/learning 

There have been numerous attempts to develop explanatory theories of learning. #todo - something here about the different models, if some have subsumed others, others have just offered a different perspective. 
It is likely that there is no one-size-fits-all theoretical model for learning. Learning is a complex process occurring within a complex system, and as such will have multiple, valid, representations [[Sources/@rosenLifeItself1991\|@rosenLifeItself1991]], [[Sources/@kittoPlacesInterveneComplex2024\|@kittoPlacesInterveneComplex2024]]. 

Obviously linked to [[theory\|theory]]. 

#todo put them theories here.
