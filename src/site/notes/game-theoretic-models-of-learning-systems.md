Understanding the *complex interactions between learners, learning and learning environments* 

There is also work on [[structural-causal-games\|structural-causal-games]] that is worth exploring. 

From chatty g:
Yes, there is a branch of game theory that examines hierarchies, often referred to as **Hierarchical Game Theory**. This field studies strategic interactions in hierarchical structures, where players have different levels of authority or roles within an organization or system. Hierarchical game theory can encompass various specific models and approaches, such as:

1. **Stackelberg Competition**: A model where leaders and followers exist, and the leader makes a decision first, followed by the followers who react to the leader's decision.
2. **Principal-Agent Models**: These focus on the relationship between principals (e.g., employers) and agents (e.g., employees) where the principal delegates tasks to the agent, who may have different objectives.
3. **Multi-Level Decision Making**: This involves decision-making processes in organizations where different levels (e.g., top management, middle management, and employees) interact strategically.

These models help in understanding how hierarchies affect strategic behavior and outcomes in various contexts, including economics, business, and political science.
