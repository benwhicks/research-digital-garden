Outlined by [[Sources/@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987\|@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987]] the Teacher - Student interaction model depicts learning as a [[game-theory-game\|Game Theoretic model]] in which the academic achievement of the student is a shared utility of both teacher and student. The teacher and student then have to decide how much effort (measured in hours) they put into the student's achievement. 

[[Sources/@montmarquetteCouldTeacherGrading1989\|@montmarquetteCouldTeacherGrading1989]] used this model to link with data on French language standardised test results, offering an explanation that some of the improved results could be attributed to more lenient grading practices. Given the potential importance of grading practices [[Sources/@bonesronningVariationTeachersGrading1999\|@bonesronningVariationTeachersGrading1999]] expanded the model to include a student behaviour of seeking to influence the grading practice of the teacher ('rent seeking').
