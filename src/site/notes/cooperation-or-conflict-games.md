#mathematical-modelling/game-theory 
Several [[game-theory-game\|Game Theory Games]] fall into a category of trying to understand cooperation, or conflict. Mathematically the notions are identical, the distinction between conflict and cooperation is an epistemological one. Generally, players have a choice to cooperate, $C$, or defect $D$. We can then articulate the payoff matrix as follows (payoff to row player):

|   | **D**efect | **C**ooperate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D**efect | **N**eutral | **T**emptation |
| **C**ooperate | **P**unishment | **C**oordination |
