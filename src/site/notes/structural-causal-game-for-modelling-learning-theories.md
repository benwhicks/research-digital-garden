Structural Causal Games might offer a way to link models of unseen learning processes, and our theoretical models o these, to learning data. [[Sources/@hammondReasoningCausalityGames2023a\|@hammondReasoningCausalityGames2023a]] offer a way to move from a [[directed-acyclic-graph\|DAG]] to a [[structural-causal-games\|causal game]], and vice versa. It might be easier to express [[theories-of-learning\|model of learning]] in terms of a [[game-theory-game\|game]] and this then provides the bridge to a data interpretation, via the conditional independence implications of a [[directed-acyclic-graph\|DAG]].
