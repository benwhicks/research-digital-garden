# PR - Bio

Ben is a PhD candidate with the Connected Intelligence Centre, UTS, Sydney. Benâ€™s research interests are in using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and other tools to include a greater breadth of expertise in the (participatory) design of Learning Analytics (LA) products that better encapsulate the complexity of learning. He has the first paper on Causal DAGs in the LA community (Hicks et al., 2022). Ben has experience teaching in high school classrooms across three continents which informs his appreciation of the complexity of learning and the value of localised tacit knowledge of learning systems. He enjoys using his background in abstract mathematics to help find approaches to difficult problems that other fields have used and reimagining them in education.
