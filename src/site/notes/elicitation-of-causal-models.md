#graphical-modelling 
#participatory-modelling 

A form of [[knowledge-elicitation\|knowledge-elicitation]], using [[domain-experts\|domain-experts]] to elicit potential [[causal-dags\|Causal DAG]]. This has a strong relationship with [[participatory-systems-mapping\|participatory-systems-mapping]], which is a more general approach to mapping (drawing graphs of) causal systems. 

## Advice

	- (1) Treatment and Outcome
	- (2) Other [[causality\|causes]]
	- (3) Other [[effect\|effects]]
	- (4) Unobserved causes

- the very end of this [edX course](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions "https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions"). 

This is viewed slightly differently by [[human-technology-institute\|human-technology-institute]] in that they are more interested in [[elicitation-of-causal-model-priors\|elicitation-of-causal-model-priors]] which then feed into causal discovery algorithms - a nice way to combine the two.

## Notes

- Write up concerns around group dynamics around the early session. Group session dynamics. 
	- When did the lower power dynamic speak up and question? Can we usurp the power dynamics in some way through the diagram? Does the shared diagram enforce, or subvert, power dynamics?
	- Is there a coding around "questioning", "supporting" for the dialogues - like the argument mapping?

There is a real big challenge though in handling different perspectives around complex systems though, as they might be incompatible but also both valid. This idea was originally from Robert Rosen in “Life Itself” but Andrew Gibson and Kirsty wrote about it in a recent LAK paper as well:

## Notes from paper:

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-020-01055-z as structure elicitation example "Exploring the key drivers of forest flammability in wet eucalypt forests using expert-derived conceptual models" --
% Protocol (noted as broadly following Walshe and Burgman, below) This involved identifying factors of importance, refining the list of factors and the descriptions of those factors, developing individual conceptual models, and then developing group models (Fig. 2):
% (1) List of factors developed as a group. 8 most important used for next step
% (2) Conceptural model development. Models drawn independently, with the 8 factors, 5 from the initial list. Unclear what guidance is used
% (3) Participants review factors, 2 more are added.
% (4) Participants grouped by the kind of model they developed. Groups worked on models with a limit of 12 factors, with at least 8 from the existing list. Consensus not required - groups can splinter if needed, or develop own individual model
% Note that this process was completed over 2.5 day workshop, 21 experts, 4 facilitators

% SHELF one more about eliciting detail on a small number of variables, but estimating their conditional probability distributions (which is conceptually quite hard, but important causaly) - https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.lib.uts.edu.au/doi/10.1002/pst.2212 - "Eliciting judgements about dependent quantities of interest: The SHeffield ELicitation Framework extension and copula methods illustrated using an asthma case study"

% BARD - Bayesian ARgumentation via Delphi (BARD), which combines BNs with a Delphi social process: a systematic method for combining multiple perspectives in a democratic, reasoned, iterative manner. Delphi is anonymised remote sharing of work (through the foyer thing in the paper). The BARD method links the Variables -> Structure -> Parameters -> Model exploration -- all as part of the same linked process. So more detailed (and onorous) than a DAG - more affordances at the end but at a cost, you have to deal with conditional probability estimates which is HARD.
% https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.13759 which is more around an overall process, little advice on the structure elicitation other than it is crowdsourced and an iterative process that uses the parameters as well (perhaps unecessarily complex and time consuming)
% From the eucalypt one: To do this, we broadly followed recommendations in the literature for eliciting individual and group conceptual models (Walshe and Burgman 2010). This involved identifying factors of importance, refining the list of factors and the descriptions of those factors, developing individual conceptual models, and then developing group models (Fig. 2). 

% Also the SHELF work - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35373454/ - perhaps most relevant. Again, looks heavily at parameters and estimating amounts, less focussed on the structure - actually - not focussed on structure AT ALL, just on conditional distribution estimates. But still interesting stuff. Actually, this is good to point to as how much work goes into just doing conditional probabilities, as an example of the thing above being overkill perhaps. 


% Cognitive mapping elicitation example - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19878485/ - Walshe and B - seems less relevant directly but had stuff on cognitive map elicitation:::
% from Walshe and B - Elicitation involvesselecting relevant concepts, and specifying the direc-tion, sign (positive or negative), and strength of thecausal associations between nodes. (Hodgkinson GP, Maule AJ, Brown, NJ. Causal cognitivemapping in the organizational strategy ﬁeld: A comparisonof alternative elicitation procedures. Organizational ResearchMethods, 2004; 7:3–26)
% By specifying the signand strength of association between concepts, cog-nitive maps overcome the problem of indeterminacyand allow inferences under various what-if scenar-ios.(Kosko B. Fuzzy cognitive maps. International Journal ofMan-Machine Studies, 1986; 24:65–75) Causal links can be translated to an equiva-lent adjacency matrix, providing a means of numer-ically characterizing and comparing cognitive maps.Where maps are constructed from a common poolof concepts dissimilarity metrics describing the node-by-node and arc-by-arc differences between a pairof cognitive maps have been developed.(Langﬁeld-Smith KM, Wirth A. Measuring differences be-tween cognitive maps. Journal of the Operational ResearchSociety, 1992; 43:1135–1150) 
% Compared to cognitive maps, Bayes nets pro-vide greater inferential clarity, at a cost of an in-creased elicitation burden on experts in the speciﬁ-cation of marginal and conditional probabilities.(42)
% Facilitated discussion reduces differences be-tween maps but will rarely eliminate all differences.People become attached (anchored) to a particularmap. Numerical methods for aggregation can createa consensus map of a problem.(Scavarda AJ, Bouzdine-Chameeva T, Goldstein SM, HaysJM, Hill, AV. A methodology for constructing collectivecausal maps. Decision Sciences, 2006; 37:263–283.)

Advice on how to draw causal DAGs with domain experts is sparse.
\citet{mcelreath2022horoscopesLecture20} suggests a four step process: (i) describe the treatment and outcome, then; (ii) other causes; (iii); other effects; and then (iv) unobserved outcomes. 
\citet{barbrook-johnsonParticipatorySystemsMapping2022} offer more extensive advice on \textit{participatory systems mapping}, but it is aimed at a more general category of GCMs under the umbrella of \textit{system maps}
\footnote{\textbf{Terminology: }There is overlapping and sometimes ambiguous terminology in the literature. System maps and GCMs are a broad range of graphical models that describe causal flow using nodes and directed edges (visually referred to as a \textit{causal diagram}). Causal DAGs are a particular type of GCM, and also known as \textit{Bayesian belief networks} (BBNs) \cite{barbrook-johnsonBayesianBeliefNetworks2022}. When a causal DAG is given functional structure between the variables is becomes a \textit{structural causal model} (SCM)\cite{peters2017elements}. The SCM always has an induced graph, the \textit{causal diagram} \citep[p.~203]{pearl2009causality}, commonly referred to as a DAG, which we are referring to more precisely as a \textit{causal} DAG. A DAG itself does not need to be interpreted causally, it is simply a particular kind of graph. In this paper all reference to model, DAG, GCM, causal diagram or systems map in this paper will mean the diagrammatic representation of a system through the causal relationship between variables. This is all confusing enough without getting into structural equation models (SEMs), which are equations between variables from which you can draw a path diagram, which looks like a DAG. SEMs are tightly linked to causal DAGs (sometimes referred to as non-parametric SEMs \cite{balgiDeepLearningDAGs2025}) conceptually and historically but are used for different purposes \cite{weidlichCausalReasoningCausal2023}.}.
Their advice is weighted towards session planning, focus and participant engagement, such as: setting a clear aim and boundaries for the problem space, selecting a diverse range of experts, carefully explaining the graphical rules, encouraging participants to take control, and ``zooming in and out'' when stuck.
On guiding experts through the graphical model development itself they suggest a cycle of thinking about which factors, drawing connections between them, then verification and review. 
% Where should this go? Maybe ditch? I've mooved it a few times.
There is in-depth work in the elicitation of other forms of GCM such as \textit{Bayesian networks}, a framework that also includes the conditional probability relationships between variables. 
However, these methods must put significant resources into estimating these conditional probability relationships in conjunction with the causal structure, such as including software tool supported elicitation \cite{nyberg2022bard, fenton2014softwareRiskAssessmentBNs, gosling2017shelf}.
%, carefully structured multi-day workshops \cite{theEucalyptOne}, and sophisticated protocols \cite{SHELF}.
Although this can produce a more powerful analytical tool than a causal DAG it comes at the cost of estimating conditional probabilities, an exceptionally challenging concept fraught with counterintuitive examples \cite{saenen2018humans}, and not needed for DAGs.
%\citet{nyberg2022bard} is one example elicitation methodology example that uses a software tool to help encorporate the knowledge of multiple experts under a Delphi protocol. 
%In this protocol the structure elicitation is tied together with variable selection, estimation of parameters, and model exploration, as an iterative process. 
%In fact there is rich work on the elicitation of conditional probabilities between a pair of variables (CHECK IT IS A PAIR AT A TIME) \cite{SHELF-protocol}.
%This avenue is likely too onerous a path for learning systems that can have several highly connected factors \cite{thomas2021experiment}.
% As such, this work has focused on a non-parametric causal modelling approach using causal DAGs as the main focus.
