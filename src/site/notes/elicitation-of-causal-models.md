#graphical-modelling 
#participatory-modelling 

A form of [[knowledge-elicitation\|knowledge-elicitation]], using [[context-experts\|context-experts]] to elicit potential [[causal-dags\|Causal DAG]]. This has a strong relationship with [[participatory-systems-mapping\|participatory-systems-mapping]], which is a more general approach to mapping (drawing graphs of) causal systems. 

This is viewed slightly differently by [[human-technology-institute\|human-technology-institute]] in that they are more interested in [[elicitation-of-causal-model-priors\|elicitation-of-causal-model-priors]] which then feed into causal discovery algorithms.
