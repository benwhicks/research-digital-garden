#theory

Often there is a challenge in bridging the gap between our qualitative understanding of a system, through [[theory\|theory]] or relevant experts in the system itself, and the understanding of the data generated by that system. We cannot expect [[data-experts\|data experts]] to be across the breadth of knowledge available for what they are analysing, nor can we expect an expert in a particular system to understand all the nuances of data analysis ([[context-experts\|context expert]]). This is a gap that should be expected in most circumstances, however with increasingly sophisticated and obfuscating suite of data analysis options ( #getref along the lines of black boxes, llms, etc), along with the need to understanding increasingly connected and complex systems, there is a real risk of analytics becoming poorly fitted to their practical applications.
