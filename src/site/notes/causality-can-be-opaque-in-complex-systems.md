Causality in a [[complex-system\|complex system]] can be difficult to examine. The property of [[emergence\|emergence]], often talked about as a quality of complex systems, results when the behaviour 'emerges' from patterns and interactions, not from a readily discernable chain of events. There is also the notion of [[delegated-causality\|delegated causality]], dual to interventional causality, outlined in this #read - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-018-9377-3 .
