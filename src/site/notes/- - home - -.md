This is [[People/Ben Hicks\|my]] [[extended-mind\|extended mind]] for [[my-publications\|my research]], part of which is headed towards a PhD in [[learning-analytics\|Learning Analytics]] with [[connected-intelligence-centre\|CIC]] at [[university-of-technology-sydney\|UTS]]. I am interested in how we understand and model [[complex-system\|complex systems]], particularly those in [[education-system\|education]]. I have spent over a decade in the classroom prior to diving into the world of data, so understanding the [[tacit-knowledge\|tacit-knowledge]] of [[domain-experts\|context experts]] in education drives a lot of my research agenda. 

- My PhD supervisors can keep track of my semi-structured plan details in the [[- working-notebook -\|- working-notebook -]].
- I sometimes write on a blog: https://koanmathematics.wordpress.com/

> This is my notes on thinking, which I am happy to throw out into the public sphere. Not everything is included though - any notes on organisations or people should be suppressed (a 404 error on clicking on them) and certain notes on upcoming writing as well.

# Research Overview

## Core beliefs / axioms / bias

Embedded in this are some of my underlying biases / hypotheses:
-  [[there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality\|there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality]] 
-  [[thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding\|thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding]]
-  [[thinking-abstractly-is-accessible\|thinking-abstractly-is-accessible]]
- [[learning-is-complex\|education is complex]]
- learning has important aspects that [[intangible-data\|may be intangible]]
- …and lastly, [[causal-reasoning-is-a-very-human-thing-to-do\|causal-reasoning-is-a-very-human-thing-to-do]]

## Research Questions

I aim to answer the following questions:

### [[RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?\|RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?]]

Useful has some (possible) subquestions, particularly around:
- [[what-education-sub-systems-are-reasonably-to-be-causally-modelled\|what-education-sub-systems-are-reasonably-to-be-causally-modelled]]? 
- [[what-do-we-do-with-non-linear-causal-models-in-education\|what-do-we-do-with-non-linear-causal-models-in-education]]? This I attempt to answer (partially) in [[Sources/@hicksGameTheoreticModels2025\|@hicksGameTheoreticModels2025]].

### [[RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?\|RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?]]

# Writing plan

## Philosophical paper


## Navigating the causal inference landscape


Could include some of the philosophical ideas, as well as the map of the landscape:

- How about [[causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity\|causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity]], and getting into the idea of local linear causation. Emergence is key here but also just levels of abstraction and where we have visibility.

	#todo/read Philosophy of models book (on Kindle)
	Material on NESS and HP causation (notes to add)
