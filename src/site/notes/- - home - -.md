This is [[People/Ben Hicks\|my]] [[extended-mind\|extended mind]] for my research, part of which is headed towards a PhD in [[learning-analytics\|Learning Analytics]] with [[connected-intelligence-centre\|CIC]] at [[university-of-technology-sydney\|university-of-technology-sydney]]. I am interested in how we understand and model [[complex-system\|complex systems]], particularly those in [[education-system\|education]]. I have spent over a decade in the classroom prior to diving into the world of data, so understanding the [[tacit-knowledge\|tacit-knowledge]] of [[context-experts\|context experts]] in education drives a lot of my research agenda. 



# Research Overview

## Research Questions

I aim to answer the following questions:
### [[RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?\|RQ1. Can non-technical experts co-design useful causal models?]]

Useful has some (possible) subquestions, particularly around:
- [[what-education-sub-systems-are-reasonably-to-be-causally-modelled\|what-education-sub-systems-are-reasonably-to-be-causally-modelled]]?
- [[what-do-we-do-with-non-linear-causal-models-in-education\|what-do-we-do-with-non-linear-causal-models-in-education]]?

### [[RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?\|RQ2. Does participating in causal modelling promote deeper thinking about a system?]]


## Core beliefs
Embedded in this are some of my underlying biases / hypotheses:
-  [[there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality\|there-is-little-point-in-understanding-data-without-causality]] 
-  [[thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding\|thinking-abstractly-is-critical-for-generalisable-understanding]]
-  [[thinking-abstractly-is-accessible\|thinking-abstractly-is-accessible]]
- [[learning-is-complex\|education is complex]]
- learning has important aspects that [[intangible-data\|intangible-data]]

# Writing plan

## Philosophical paper



## Navigating the causal inference landscape


Could include some of the philosophical ideas, as well as the map of the landscape:

- How about [[causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity\|causal-inference-in-complex-systems-requires-local-linearity]], and getting into the idea of local linear causation. Emergence is key here but also just levels of abstraction and where we have visibility.

	#todo/read Scale (on Kindle)
	#todo/read Philosophy of models book (on Kindle)

What are we trying to do when we do statistical modelling in education?
