The literature on a topic can be represented as a causal graph [[Sources/@gramesSystematicMethodHypothesis2022\|@gramesSystematicMethodHypothesis2022]], [[Sources/@mikkolaCausalVariablesCommunity2024\|@mikkolaCausalVariablesCommunity2024]]. Each paper represents a causal claim, or set of causal claims, that can be represented as a path between variables. The collection of these can form a [[causal-dags\|DAGs]] or a similar [[graphical-causal-model\|Graphical Causal Model]].
