#theory/systems

A complex system can be defined in a variety of ways. Rosen ( #todo get reference to Life Itself), and later Louie ( #todo import reference to More than Life Itself) note that a complex system has multiple valid representations - it can be modelled in a variety of different ways. Dave Snowden notes that complex systems are fundamentally different to ordered (simple or complicated) systems in that there is no linear material cause. They are entangled. Both these schools of thought push against the idea that a complex system can be reduced to the sum of it's parts, and that knowing how these parts work somehow informs how the system as a whole will behave. 

Frequently, these are discussed in [[complex-adaptive-system\|complex adaptive systems]], which are complex systems that also adapt to stimuli over time. 

#todo In general, [[causality-can-be-opaque-in-complex-systems\|causality-can-be-opaque-in-complex-systems]]. Should talk about [[emergence\|emergence]] at some point - it's a feature of complex systems that seems a critical distinction. [[game-theory-offers-simple-emergenct-effects\|game-theory-offers-simple-emergenct-effects]], which might be useful. It might also be useful to explore the [[different-ways-a-system-can-be-complex\|different-ways-a-system-can-be-complex]].

[[Sources/@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a\|@jacobsonConceptualizingDebatesLearning2016a]] describe some key aspects of complex systems. One example is how a smaller scale phenomena can produce very different behaviour at a larger scale, often called [[emergence\|emergence]].

> For example, in a traffic system the macro-level formation of a traffic jam propagates backwards even though the individual cars at the micro-level general move forward as they speed up or slow down, with some lateral lane changes but rarely do the cars move backwards in traffic. \hfill (p. 211)


Holland (2006) and others make a distinction between a [[complex-adaptive-system\|complex-adaptive-system]] where agents adapt, change and evolve, and a [[complex-non-adaptive-system\|complex-non-adaptive-system]] where they do not.
