# Notes

## Grant application example

## Chatting with KK April 2024

> [!tldr] Musings
> - I tend to write introductions as though I am introducing myself to the topic in the first paragraph. Very broad and far ranging. Don't. The second paragraph is usually a better starting point. 
> - Keep cycling back to the aims of a paper. Why is it there. 

## Feedback on first draft of IML ethics

> [!tldr] Main points
> - Greater clarity for a broader audience needed in sections
> - Improve the description of selection process and technical aspects of the analysis and data storage.
> - Think about relevance to the ethical design of the research: RCT comment, 'range of confidence' of experts, UTS or not? Lots of this can possibly be omitted.  
> - Elaborate on ethical decisions, don't assume the audience knows why you made that choice.
> - Address the evaluation section 

> [!warning] Ask these questions
> - The selection of participants, particularly the 'range' of expertise. What I'm doing is kind of opportunistic, based on work that is going around and interest. Is this ok? (Suggest removing "range of confidence" - not needed). Check with the 'omissions' noted above
> - Evaluation - I'm not 100% sure what should go there. Is this what is required to answer the RQ? Ask KK and SBS first.
> - Need to clarify feedback loops, reflexive cycles. I feel I get the gist of what they are, and do that, but need to formalise. Ask KK and SBS first. 
> - Where do you want the references? In each section or all at the bottom?

### Classifying changes

#### Writing
##### Be more precise and clear
- Changed "how we use data" to "how to use data in decision making"
- Clearer definition for context experts - which contexts?
##### Set the context for a broader audience 
- Asked for an opening about what LA is (I jumped straight into the problems LA is facing)
- Asked for clarification on what the "statistical models / machine learning" might be used for in the context of students
##### Stay on the heading topic
- Last section on "evaluation" and "research outcomes" bleeds into significance of the study (probably from having this written for the RM application first)

#### Research design considerations

##### Selection of participants
- I used "range of confidence in the technical side" but didn't specify how this would occur in the selection of participants. Would this include "zero confidence", for instance? I think this will be kind of self-selecting but that needs to be spelt out more clearly. 
- Asked for more clarity on the selection criteria for models. Are there certain disciplines / schools?
- "Direct approach" called out. Need to consider power relationships / coercion. 
- Unclear if participants are UTS only
- Who are the context experts (in evaluation)? Teachers? Examples really needed. 

##### Elaborate on ethical decisions - why?
- Participants can review their transcript - why did I offer this?

##### More detail on technical aspects

 - How will the recordings be stored? What privacy will be in place? How will they be used and when security discarded?
 - Data on OneDrive: "data needs to be protected through password access to project team only"
 - What is your coding method: an electronic platform like nVivo or manually?
 - For evaluation section: "What are your feedback loops, reflexive cycles to understand what worked and what did not work"

 ##### Relevance for an ethics application - you are not on a soap box!
 
- Point on "move beyond an overreliance upon randomised controlled trials (RCTs)" - this needed a citation, but also: "How does this relate to your design and methodology? What is your agenda? Suggest this statement is not needed in an ethics application."
 

### Positives
- Clear questions. Yay! They have gone through MANY changes.
- It would be nice to see UTS staff be exposed to this study. Please consider a presentation at the UTSÂ  T+L Forum
