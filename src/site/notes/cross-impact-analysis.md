> Cross-impact methods are planning, foresight and decision support tools often used in conjunction with the scenario technique (Gordon, 1994; Godet et al., 1991, 1994). They enable systems modeling in a theory-driven way, grounded in expert judgment and understanding. Cross-impact methods as modeling and analysis approaches fall in between empirical data-driven computational models and argumentative systems analysis, and they exhibit a high degree of disciplinary heterogeneity and focus on expert-sourced soft system knowledge (Weimer-Jehle, 2006). 
> The utility of cross-impact analysis is to provide deep insights into the operating logic of a system with complex interactions between its elements. A decision support-oriented utility for cross-impact models is to use them in examining the impacts of strategic choices, policy interventions or changes in the system. They are normally based on expert-sourced data on the interactions between system components, and thus enable modeling of systems that do not have ample empirical data that is required in use of traditional data-driven modeling techniques.Cross-impact analysis has become a popular technique for systems and decision analysis and well established in the fields of foresight and futures studies (Gordon, 1994; Godet et al., 1994; Cagnin et al., 2016).
