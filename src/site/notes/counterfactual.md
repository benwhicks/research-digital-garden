#theory/causation 
An instance of an event that is not what actually happened - it is *counter to the facts*. This idea is used heavily to imagine [[parallel-worlds\|parallel-worlds]] to calculate causal effects in the [[potential-outcomes-framework\|potential-outcomes-framework]], and is also regarded as the highest level of reasoning in Pearl’s [[causal-hierarchy\|ladder of causation]].

These are also easily described in how [[causal-reasoning-is-a-very-human-thing-to-do\|causal-reasoning-is-a-very-human-thing-to-do]].
