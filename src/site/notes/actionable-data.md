Making decisions on data, such as designing an intervention or setting policy, requires more than just associations. To take such a decision with any confidence requires some trust that the data informs our [[causality\|causal]] knowledge of the system, that what we are doing will affect some change [[Sources/@bennettOpeningBlackBox2016\|@bennettOpeningBlackBox2016]]. This has led to the nomenclature of 'actionable data'  

Within [[learning-analytics\|Learning Analytics]] (LA) this has fallen under the umbrella of 'actionable LA' [[Sources/@kennedyEditorialActionableLearning2025\|@kennedyEditorialActionableLearning2025]], 

In fact, it could be argued that [[policy-is-the-enaction-of-causal-theory\|policy-is-the-enaction-of-causal-theory]].

> Those who make decisions in organizations and set policy are asking “what works?” questions (Donmoyer, 2012), and these questions often involve evaluating cause and effect, even if with imperfect understandings. We act in the belief that an action has the ability to affect outcomes
