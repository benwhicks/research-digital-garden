#mathematical-modelling/game-theory 
A behaviour in group dynamics where people aim to receive the group benefit whilst contributing minimal effort. In a [[cooperation-or-conflict-games\|cooperation game]] this amounts to choosing a "defect" or "non-cooperative" strategy or decision. 

Seems very similar to [[rent-seeking\|rent-seeking]], a concept from economics where agents increase their own wealth without creating any benefit to society.
