- [ ] Thrive - any opportunities for the data collection in the next session with DoE? Can we connect to their big dataset? Reach out to Roman. 

- [ ] Reply to Josh
- [x] Download of all assurance sessions ✅ 2025-07-07

Talking to people - Jan is the Simon level of XIML. Might be a good contrast of assessment. Also Sophie at Wollongong uni.
- [x] Simon to contact Jan. Flat out and at HERDSA atm but would be good to talk to. Likes thinking in Systems. ✅ 2025-07-21
	- [x] Follow up meeting schedule for [[People/Jan McLean\|Jan McLean]] ✅ 2025-07-22
- [ ] Amanda? Was senior lecturer in FASS. [[People/Amanda Lizier\|Amanda Lizier]] - expert in assessment design. 
- [ ] Right up concerns around group dynamics around the early session. Group session dynamics. 
	- [ ] When did the lower power dynamic speak up and question? Can we usurp the power dynamics in some way through the diagram? Does the shared diagram enforce, or subvert, power dynamics?
	- [ ] Is there a coding around "questioning", "supporting" for the dialogues - like the argument mapping?

# Routines

- 2 x 25 min writing blocks. Could try 5 min editing as a transition activity?
- 1 x 25 min reading / learning block (can be DoE related)
- Leave reference hunting and sorting for the end of the day / downtime. Could even do editing then as well. 


# Other tasks

#todo/read - https://proceedings.mlr.press/v177/ahsan22a/ahsan22a.pdf something on cycles!!


#todo/read settable systems: an extension of pearls causal model with optimisation, equilibrium, and learning. Might be good for ... ??

- [ ] Build list of reading from KK paper recommendation on Bayesian model elicitation. Place in [[elicitation-of-causal-models\|elicitation-of-causal-models]]
