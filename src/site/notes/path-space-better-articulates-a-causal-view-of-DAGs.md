Describing the [[space-of-possible-DAGs\|space-of-possible-DAGs]] is challenging, and problematic for exploring this space during [[causal-discovery\|causal-discovery]]. Neighbouring DAGs may not being close in terms of their causal interpretation. For instance "adding a mediator", B,  to the path A -> C is a fairly minor [[causal-graph-operation\|causal-graph-operation]] in terms of causal thinking but involves three operations on the [[adjacency-matrix\|adjacency-matrix]]: deleting the path A -> C, then adding the path A -> B and A -> C, so would in a sense be three operations away from each other in the [[adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs\|adjacency-matrix-space-of-DAGs]]. 

See [[path-space-of-DAGs\|path-space-of-DAGs]] for a description of how we might articulate and navigate this space.
