### Notes

In the presence of pervasive computing, and persistent user-data, there are opportunities for the building of lifelong learner models for more personalised learning, learning augmentation, and greater cohesion between the learner and their digital learning systems. These learner models will need ongoing maintenance, continually being re-assessed by the user and the systems that utilise them. The user should be able to understand and scrutinise their model, and the systems should be able to use the model to reason about the learner. The scrutability of the model requires these models to be *open* and allow the user to *interface* with the model.

> Much of this paper has been devoted to two of the foundations for the lifelong user model: the systems issues and the inextricably linked challenges of creating interfaces to the model. There are many questions yet to be explored. Is the lifelong user model too dangerous because it aggregates so much data about the individual learner? Our vision has been driven by the view that the lifelong user model must have a simple representation, with minimal reasoning, leaving that to applications. Will that give learners enough information to realize the important potential of the lifelong user model for supporting reflection, monitoring, and planning learning? What is the appropriate granularity for the user model ontology and the evidence that is collected about the learner? If is too fine-grained, will it be overwhelming to the point of being useless? If it is too coarse-grained, will we have lost valuable possibilities for data mining that were never envisaged at the time the model was defined? Our vision is based on a lifelong user model where large parts of the model are highly specialized with the reuse and value involving learner interaction with the model, even if applications cannot reuse all of it. Can we create interfaces that make this practical and valuable for learning? It is certain that we are creating huge collections of digital artifacts and that many computers hold large collections of information about us. The lifelong user model aims to harness these and make them really work for the learner, being available as needed, supporting all aspects of the life, and, importantly, ensuring that the learner maintains a sense of control over the model, its use, and their own learning.
