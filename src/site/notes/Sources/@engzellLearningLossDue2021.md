# Notes

- The causal influence could be background trauma - there was an event (pandemic) that weighed on students' minds. Don't think so but it's another thing to consider. 
- Causal modelling could be useful - there is plenty of work on loss to follow up and confounding, it is unclear how they interact with each other / nest. 
- What does it mean to "regress"? Is forgetting part of the mix? How much is this knowledge based on continual reminders?? Depressing.
