> Young people worldwide face new challenges as climate change and complex family structures disrupt societies. These challenges impact on youth's subjective well-being, with evidence of decline across many countries. While the burden of negative well-being on productivity is widely examined amongst adults, its cost among youth remains understudied. The current research comprehensively investigates the relationship between youth subjective well-being and standardized academic test scores. We use highly controlled machine learning models on a moderately-sized high-school student sample (Nâ€‰~â€‰3400), with a composite subjective well-being index (composed of depression, anxiety and positive affect), to show that students with greater well-being are more likely to have higher academic scores 7â€“8Â months later (on Numeracy: Î²*â€‰=â€‰.033, pâ€‰=â€‰.020). This effect emerges while also accounting for previous test scores and other confounding factors. Further analyses with each well-being measure, suggests that youth who experience greater depression have lower academic achievement (Numeracy: Î²*â€‰=â€‰-â€‰.045, pâ€‰=â€‰.013; Reading: Î²*â€‰=â€‰-â€‰.033, pâ€‰=â€‰.028). By quantifying the impact ofÂ youth well-being, and in particularÂ of lowering depression, this research highlights its importance for the next generation's health and productivity.
