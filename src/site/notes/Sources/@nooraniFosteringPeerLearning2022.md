Theoretical basis is peer learning ^[Topping, K. J. (2005). Trends in peer learning. Educational psychology, 25(6):631â€“645.], but also wanting to avoid [[free-riders\|free-riders]]. [[learning-design\|learning-design]] is then based on the [[prisoners-dilemma\|prisoners-dilemma]] strategies, mapped onto the [[learning-design\|learning-design]]. The framework, or model, is PD_PL, for prisoners dilemma peer learning. 

In [[prisoners-dilemma\|PD]] both strategy profiles (Defect, Defect) and (Cooperate, Cooperate) are [[nash-equilibrium\|nash-equilibrium]] and [[pareto-optimum\|pareto-optimum]], respectively. No single player gets a benefit from changing from a (Defect, Defect) scenario. (Cooperate, Cooperate) is a [[pareto-optimum\|Pareto efficiency]], that is the other strategy profiles do not contribute more to the whole. The challenge as a learning designer is that we want the Pareto set, but individuals will gravitate towards the NE. 

The mechanism involved being able to change teammates and also assessing them. Peer effort evaluation was visible. Overall the design had a positive effect on learning outcomes and minimising [[free-riders\|free-riders]] behaviour.
