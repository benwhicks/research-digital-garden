Builds on the model from [[Sources/@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987\|@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987]] to examine unexplained variation in school achievements. Concerned with [[grade-inflation\|grade-inflation]]

They highlight that with a [[teacher-student-interaction-model\|teacher-student-interaction-model]], a [[game-theory\|game-theory]] model, that a "harder grading will cause a positive response if the student's preferences are such that the elasticity of substitution between academic and nonacademic activities exceeds 1 ^[That is that the exchange is [[elasticity\|elastic]]] [[Sources/@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987\|@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987]].

They note that:

They then build on the idea of a grading parameter for both the teacher and the student, and finally conclude that *grading does matter* and some effects in the data might be explained by a latent variable of grading severity.

> Derived as a latent variable from an error components model on class grade regressions, this variable leads us to the empirical evidence that a *lenient grading practice* improves the French standardized test results of young students.
