**RQ: “What is the impact of LADs on students’ learning outcomes?”**

Aims to explore the impact of [[learning-analytics-dashboard\|Learning Analytics dashboard]]s on [[student-learning-outcomes\|student-learning-outcomes]], through a meta-analysis of the current literature. Student learning outcomes can be conceptualised differently, depending on the researches perspective or model of learning. A [[sociocultural-learning-model\|sociocultural]] perspective might focus on dialogue, a [[cognitivist-learning-model\|cognitivist]] perspective might focus on grades / achievement, or a [[self-regulated-learning-model\|self-regulated-learning-model]] might focus on learning behaviours, which are then linked to better academic outcomes. This paper ignores these, instead taking a "bottom-up approach" to evaluation.

> This study identifies the effect size of individual dashboard studies on different aspects of students’ learning outcomes to address the general concerns about their effectiveness and to facilitate further research and application.

> With the view that the primary goal of LA is to support learning [11] in this study, we explore the impact of LADs-arguably the main intervention point for LA, based on one particular proposition (i.e., whether they support students’ learning outcomes).

It does look at four dimensions of [[student-learning-outcomes\|student-learning-outcomes]]:

> [!quote] 
> This research question delves into the impact of LADs on various dimensions of students’ learning outcomes (e.g., achievement, participation, engagement, motivation, attitude) as reported by the analysed studies.
> ...
> The analysis revealed four main learning outcome indicators: (1) academic achievement, which includes an exploration of whether the use of LADs has a discernible effect on student’s academic performance, including their grades, assessment scores, and overall performance in educational contexts; (2) motivation, which focuses on LADs potential to bolster students’ motivation to learn; (3) participation including active involvement in classroom discussions, group projects, and other activities, and, (4) attitudes toward learning, such as self-efficacy and anxiety.
