Extends the work by [[Sources/@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987\|@correaTeacherstudentInteractionGame1987]] of teacher-student effort, combining with work from [[Sources/@selimEducationMarketEgypt2008\|@selimEducationMarketEgypt2008]], and another I couldn't find from Fukahiru (2005). Also works on using migration - views in the context of "global competition and human migration: the national public education systems are subsystems of a global, interconnected system". 

Essentially builds the models (below) to make a qualitative argument around teacher funding, and incentives, and the overall results. The end result:

- In an emerging economy: in context of scarce public resources, an educational policy based on a strategic objective called, in brief “social peace” --> a low quality of the educational process
- In an ideal free market economy: the direct and feedback relations between universities and private companies decrease the pressure on the public educational budget and stimulate both Teacher and Student to co-create value.  
- The proposed qualitative approaches are thought as starting points for developing future research frames dedicated to higher education quality, integrating specific instruments such as interviews and statistical data processing.
