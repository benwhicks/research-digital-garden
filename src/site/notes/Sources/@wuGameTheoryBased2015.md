Published by some high school students! (with support from some MIT folk). #mathematical-modelling/game-theory 

Looks at the challenge of [[peer-feedback\|peer-feedback]], in particular peer-grading in online courses. Sets up the objective function as student happiness (a [[intangible-data\|intangible-data]]). Frames this in game-theoretic terms, but only in as much as it is using the idea of a procedural "mechanism" to describe behaviour, and that these are based on "game theory", but it is a little unclear how.
