and populations, it is necessary to identify competing hypotheses, processes and ideas to build conceptual models of how systems operate. [(p. 2079)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2079&annotation=46HT5SGA)

One solution is to rely on expert opinion, which can improve models of systems for which data are scarce or difficult to obtain, or when predictions are needed ur- gently to inform policy (Enders et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2012).  Models developed in this manner, though, can be subject to inher- ent biases when relying on experts, such as groupthink, confirma- tion bias and priority being given to ideas suggested by influential participants (Burgman et al., 2011; Drescher et al., 2013; Krueger et al., 2012). More commonly, researchers develop conceptual models based on the results of previous research in an ad hoc and opaque manner that is not transferable or repeatable (Dochtermann & Jenkins, 2011).

For complex systems, which are common in environmental science, a more flexible approach is often neces- sary. Network-based approaches to model development are advan- tageous because they allow for: interacting modules that represent related subsets of major hypotheses; multiple types of relationships between hypotheses, evidence and theory; integration of evidence and ideas across multiple scales; quantitative analysis of qualita- tive information and expansion and consolidation as ideas evolve.  Because of these properties, network approaches to conceptual model development are well suited to many problems in environ- mental science and potentially other fields.

Our approach advocates the following steps: (a) that researchers explicitly define the scope of their research question, (b) conduct a systematic review to identify an exhaustive set of prior studies on the topic, (c) extract hypotheses that have been proposed or tested by other researchers, (d) use graphical analysis to synthe- size the results as a process-based conceptual model and (e) use net- work analysis to explore patterns in how scientific thinking about the system has evolved over time and other axes such as space or phylogeny.

the data of interest from each article are the authors' hypotheses. Hypotheses represent ex- planations of phenomena and imply causality, even when proximate mechanisms are omitted (Betts et al., 2021). Because hypotheses have implied causality, they can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in which each node represents a concept and the edges between the nodes indicate a causal relationship and the expected directionality of that relationship (Laubach et al., 2021) [(p. 2,080)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,080&annotation=Z34N8LU4)

In a conventional review, authors may synthesize these alternative hypotheses narratively; however, this does not allow for more rigorous synthesis, identifica- tion of mediating processes, or the search for links between hypoth- eses across studies. Representing hypotheses as DAGs places them into a common framework that can be synthesized and analysed. [(p. 2,080)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,080&annotation=AXSWPDYU)

should identify hypotheses from the introduction, study objectives and methods section. Each hypothesis should then be written as an implied causal pathway (e.g. X → Y) that can be converted to a DAG, with as many linked concepts and mediating processes as suggested by the original authors [(p. 2,080)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,080&annotation=3VDY6FQG)

(c) researchers extract authors' hypotheses as implied causal relationships that are (d) merged into a graphical model that can be (e) analysed to identify trends in scientific thinking [(p. 2,080)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,080&annotation=QPHFU8CK)


>[!quote|#e56eee]

Thus, we can write the implied causal pathways: (a) forest size → male age ratio, (b) forest size → return rates → territory vacancy and (c) age → body condition ← forest size. These causal pathways can then be unified into a DAG representing the authors' hypotheses (Figure 1c-3). Not all studies will present hypotheses in ways that are easily converted to an implied causal pathway; for more examples, see Grames (2022a). [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=5N7QH7X5)

researchers should also extract any metadata or study characteristics identified in the first stage of the process that could be used to examine trends in hypotheses or conceptual model structure. [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=ZZWBMBR9)

>[!quote|#5fb236] Reference

These types of metadata can be used to build mul- tilevel networks to understand not just how the hypotheses are linked but also how the research groups working on a topic, or connections between different study systems, develop (Nakagawa et al., 2019). [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=55LF4FJJ)

>[!quote|#e56eee]

Taking all of the implied causal pathways extracted from articles, the next step is to build a series of disconnected DAGs for each study (Figure 1c). In these graphs, each identified concept or factor is represented as a single node, and the causal relationships be- tween concepts or factors are represented as directional edges [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=W6675A95)

>[!quote|#e56eee]

hypoweavr (Grames, 2022a) includes the function gener- ate_graph() to convert all implied causal pathways written as plain text (e.g. X → Y) into a complete DAG representing the hypotheses from a single study. [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=7ZJZQUHB)

>[!quote|#e56eee]

Once each study is represented by a DAG, these individual graphs can be combined by taking the disjoint union of all graphs to form a global graph. In the global graph, all implied causal pathways from all studies are overlaid on one another and merged into a sin- gle graphical model (Figure 1d) [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=S7MEVJWB)

Nodes will only be merged if they are named in a consistent manner; however, and it may be nec- essary to first standardize terms across studies. This can be accom- plished with a hierarchical dictionary or ontology of concepts, terms representing those concepts and their synonyms. [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=I6V5ZAIR)

Once conceptual models have been developed by synthesizing all pathways from individual studies, they can be analysed to identify trends in thinking with respect to time, space or other dimensions (Figure 1e) [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=N8HFSI5C)


>[!quote|#5fb236] Reference

Because such models are structured as networks, there are numerous additional analyses that could be done [(p. 2,081)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,081&annotation=7YPDK374)

For example, users could create and analyse multilayer net- works (Boccaletti et al., 2014), incorporate bibliometric analysis into the final model (Nakagawa et al., 2019), identify shortest paths for information to pass through the model (Dijkstra, 1959), or weight paths by support of the evidence. Resulting models would also be modular and can be broken into component parts for more quantita- tive analyses, such as forming the basis for a meta-analytic structural equation model (Cheung & Chan, 2005). Users could also opt to not conduct any formal analyses on the models and instead use them as the basis for hypothesis generation, ad hoc identification of modules in need of further research, as a starting point for a workshop to discuss the future of the field, or to improve understanding of how a system functions.

To deter- mine which hypotheses are the most well studied, we could simply count the frequency with which each edge occurs across all stud- ies. [(p. 2,082)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,082&annotation=NP5PB88P)

To identify concepts frequently serving as a link between previously disconnected concepts, we also calculated edge betweenness, which is based on the number of shortest paths that include an edge [(p. 2,082)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,082&annotation=QFU4C9JF)

Not all nodes within a network are equally influential, and quan- tifying this influence can inform us about how a given concept has impacted our thinking about a topic. [(p. 2,082)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,082&annotation=NCCVLE7Z)

, re- searchers could use more nuanced measures of node centrality, such as PageRank, which considers the probability that information will reach a node based on the number of causal relationships pointing to it and adjusts this based on the amount of information flowing out of a node (Brin & Page, 1998). Because PageRank is sensitive to direc- tionality of edges and places greater emphasis on information going into, rather than out from, a node, it is useful for identifying import- ant outcomes or responses, but not causal agents. For example, in our case study we identified patch size and distance from edge as the starting point of our network because we know they lead to our main outcome of bird abundance, however, PageRank would not identify these nodes as important because more information flows out from, rather than into, them.

>[!quote|#e56eee]

To determine when these concepts emerged as the most im- portant, we also calculated PageRank centrality for all nodes in each graph within a cumulative time series using the function graph_met- rics() in hypoweavr (Grames, 2022a).

we were interested in structural differences be- tween networks over geographic space and therefore used a mea- sure of network dissimilarity. We calculated graph distance using the D-measure, a metric that accounts for topological differences, node connectivity and alpha centrality (a measure of node influence) of graphs, to generate a holistic measure of distance between graphs (Schieber et al., 2017). Higher values of dissimilarity indicate greater network structural changes and turnover of both ideas and com- plexity. Researchers could also use alternative measures of graph dissimilarity such as Hamming distance (Hamming, 1950) or graph edit distance (Sanfeliu & Fu, 1983), or analyse differences with some other approach (e.g. the number of new edges introduced).

researchers can quantify the total number of nodes (concepts) and edges (rela- tionships) in a time series of conceptual models (Figure 3c). By order- ing studies by the first year of data collection or year of publication, researchers can iteratively build conceptual models by taking the disjoint union (as described above) of pathways from studies at the current and previous time steps, resulting in a time series of cumula- tive conceptual models. This series can then be analysed to assess how many nodes and edges are included in the conceptual model at each time step to assess how scientific thought on the topic has developed over time [(p. 2,084)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,084&annotation=Q27QQLJZ)

a plateau would indicate a lack of new ideas, although there could still be consolidation of evidence for those already proposed. [(p. 2,084)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,084&annotation=QZBAHCWV)

>[!quote|#e56eee]

Missing critical ideas, connections between system components, or competing frameworks can result in biases that carry through to later stages of the scientific or synthesis process. By taking a rigorous approach not only to reviewing evidence for hypotheses but also to identifying which hypotheses should be considered in the first place, research teams can reduce bias and the risk of groupthink when initiating projects or synthesizing what is known about a system.

The main limitation of the approach outlined here is that the final conceptual model is restricted to hypotheses that have been presented and tested in the literature, and for which inclusion in the model is subject to researcher interpretation of how primary study authors described their hypotheses.

Interpreting these different types of hypoth- eses as implied causal pathways and determining which concepts represent nodes and how they are connected is the key challenge presented to researchers using this method, especially because mis-specification of nodes and edges can lead to problems with interpretation [(p. 2,085)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,085&annotation=FT8SLWGF)

>[!quote|#5fb236] Reference

Unlike a conventional narrative synthesis that at- tempts to describe and catalogue alternative hypotheses; however, the method we describe here retains a record of all decisions made that can be investigated for their effects on the final model and its interpretation. Because all extracted pathways can be connected directly back to the original study, mis-specification of nodes and edges can be overcome by discussion and conflict resolution tech- niques when multiple parties extract pathways from each study and compare their decisions (Syed & Nelson, 2015) [(p. 2,085)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,085&annotation=B28ZXW62)

>[!quote|#e56eee]

however, because the resulting model is structured as a network, experts can review pathways and consolidate syn- onymous variables into higher-order network elements. Similarly, some pathways may be subsets of major hypotheses, which can be represented with latent variables that are not directly measured or are composite variables with multiple indicators (Borsboom et al., 2003) across different levels to simplify the network without losing information from primary studies [(p. 2,085)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,085&annotation=DH643JCC)

>[!quote|#f19837]

The approach we outline here is based on principles of system- atic review and related rigorous synthesis methods (CEE, 2018; Koricheva et al., 2013) [(p. 2,085)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,085&annotation=P46IKVQ7)

>[!quote|#5fb236] Reference

In particular, it has the unique advantage of creating a structured network of interconnected hypotheses, which both places alternative hypotheses in context with one another and provides diverse avenues for quantitative analysis of qualita- tive ideas. The network can be interrogated interactively to explore links between variables and hypotheses, identify missing links that are known from other systems, or to generate new ideas by plac- ing previously unconnected hypotheses into a common framework [(p. 2,085)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EYM3V2ME?page=2,085&annotation=CVUQLDXG)

>[!quote|#5fb236] Reference

Networks and process-based models such as those resulting from this approach are inherently modular (Makela et al., 2000), mean- ing that the model can be broken down and pieced back together to build a better picture of how a system operates. It can also be separated into subgraphs based on moderating variables, allowing researchers to identify which hypotheses have only been tested in some systems and that could be applied in a new context. Once the initial network has been built, we are also able to update our under- standing and continue to track trends in scientific thought as new information becomes available.
