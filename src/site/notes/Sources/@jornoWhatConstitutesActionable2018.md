# Notes

> [!quote] Insights are only actionable if we can act on them, and expect to a better outcome.
> Insights are “actionable” because it is possible to act upon them as feedback information to promote a better end result.

> [!quote] Educators are poorly equipped to translate insights from data into plans of action.
> We have established that actionable insights currently are viewed from what we have dubbed a data-informed decision-making perspective. This is a type of rational decision making with the goal of increasing retention. The perspective does not provide any clues as to how to procure actionable insights. On the contrary, its two-step approach, which charges any investigator to first look at available data in order to extract insights and then tries to couple these with courses of action (Picciano, 2012), is alien to most educators, except in the most abstract sense. Educators tasked with interpreting data and then figuring out what to do, without a statistician or data analyst background, thus fight a losing battle when trying to connect data with their teaching practice. The results are ad hoc interpretations and courses of action (Sergis & Sampson, 2017).
