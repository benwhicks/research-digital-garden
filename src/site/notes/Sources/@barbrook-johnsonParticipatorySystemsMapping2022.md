# Notes

## Introduction

[[defining-a-system\|defining-a-system]] is hard, better to think about what to do with your system:

> ...it is possible to define almost anything as a system with enough mental gymnastics...we would rather proceed with thinking about what your system is, rather than dwelling on what a system is. 
> p2-3 

[[systems-mapping\|systems-mapping]]
> So now we know what a system is, and what a map is. Do we know what a system map is? Not quite. We should stop talking in the abstract and show you with examples, but first we need to introduce a few common components of systems maps: 
> 
> - **Network**: in its simplest sense, a network is a set of boxes connected by lines. In system maps, these lines are often directed, that is, they are arrows from one box to another. 
> - **Nodes**: the ‘boxes’ in a network are normally referred to as nodes. 
> - **Edges**: the connections, lines, or arrows between boxes are normally referred to as edges.
>  
> All except one of the methods in this book always have a network of nodes and edges, representing cause and influence between factors in a system, at their core. These networks of cause and influence are the model (i.e. the map) of the system.

### How can systems mapping be useful?

> headings, page 14 on:
> Helping us think, orient ourselves, synthesise and connect information, communicate, and extrapolate from assumptions to implications. 

> Systems mapping methods are highly usable, useful, and relatively intuitive ways to start engaging with real-world complex systems.
