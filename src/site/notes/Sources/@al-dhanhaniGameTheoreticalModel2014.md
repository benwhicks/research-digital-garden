The paper adopts the [[social-exchange-theory\|social-exchange-theory]] as a basis to build a [[game-theory\|game theoretic]] model of knowledge exchange between learners in an online environment, with the main trade being requesting help and answering questions. The [[prisoners-dilemma\|prisoners-dilemma]] is used as a starting point because of the need to analyse a situation were reciprocation is central to success of the group, and [[tit-for-tat-strategy\|tit-for-tat-strategy]] as a base starting strategy for simulation. They then suggest group reputation as a new [[tit-for-tat-strategy\|tit-for-tat-strategy]] to motivate free riders to be more collaborative.

Methods involve setting up the games, then running simulations to examine the overall fitness. 

Thoughts:
- Only one education citation, with this applied to a Moodle environment - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13614568.2023.2228249, in [[Sources/@nooraniEGTMoodleEducationalGame2023\|@nooraniEGTMoodleEducationalGame2023]]
- This model is specific to online. It could be extended to classroom (with a teacher presence, someone who answers more) or forum group (with multiple 'tutors' answering questions) to gauge design issues in forums. 
- Is one measure of fitness enough here? Or cost? Could there be a time cost, and a knowledge cost? I would have thought that the answerer of a question is also learning.

## The model (copied)

Consider that we have a group of (_N_) participants in a social application, each user is a member of _m_ groups and posts made by users are restricted to groups. Each user is able to:

- 1.Post a request. 
- 2. Answer others’ requests
- 3. Ignore a request because s/he is not able to answer it.
- 4. Ignore a request although s/he is able to answer it. Such a behaviour is known as “selfish” or “free riding”.

We also assume that :
- 1. The social application is keeping track of all requests and responses of each participant.
- 2. The social application is updating each user with the cooperation status of the other users.
- 3. The group lifetime is infinite.
- 4. All participants are active.
- 5.  The community is well established and active and in a state where it is in need of more answers rather than requests.
- 6.  Any request may have more than one answer.
