#mathematical-modelling/game-theory 

Builds on theory of [[competition-based-learning\|competition-based-learning]] to help [[student-motivation\|student-motivation]], but is implementing this in terms of game theory tournaments. (??) 

This is [[not-actually-a-game-theory-model\|not-actually-a-game-theory-model]] but rather a game-theory inspired application for [[learning-gamification\|learning-gamification]].
