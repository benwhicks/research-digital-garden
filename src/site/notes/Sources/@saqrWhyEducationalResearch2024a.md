## Learning is complex

Begins with the premise that [[learning-is-complex\|learning-is-complex]]. 

Argues agains reduce learning systems to box-and-arrow systems:

> [!quote] Learning systems are unlikely to be well represented by a causally linear system, such as a DAG
> This dynamic view is more realistic than the common b_ox-and-arrow_ models where the components of the system are rigidly assembled in a stable manner and the relationships between the components are deemed to be linear ([Figure 22.1](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#fig-diagram) B). Viewing the previous example from a linear perspective would entail that we see that the student will always have a stable relationship: enjoyment always drives engagement and achievement with little changes in the future nor any new patterns emerge. A linear view of engagement is then far from realistic.

The initial argument using student engagement as an example. 

> [!quote] Engagement is interaction-dominant
> For instance, engagement can be considered as a complex system. Engagement is then viewed as the result of interaction between different components, namely behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions [[15](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Reschly_Christenson_2022), [16](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Wang_Fredricks_2014)]. Such interactions vary between tasks, times, and contexts which are often referred to as _interaction-dominant systems_ ([Figure 22.1](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#fig-diagram) B) [[17](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Hilpert_Marchand_2018), [18](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Van_Orden_Holden_Turvey_2003)].

> [!quote] Engagement is more than the sum of it's parts
> Engagement follows Gestalt principles, meaning that engagement is considered more than just the sum of its parts (i.e., engagement ≠ emotions+cognition+behavior) [[16](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Wang_Fredricks_2014)],

> [!quote] Engagement involves feedback
> most engagement theories describe feedback loops (for instance, achievement drives further engagement and vice versa) [[19](https://lamethods.github.io/chapters/ch22-conclusion/ch22-conclusion.html#ref-Tinto_2022)]

## System dynamics needed

Suggests that we need to understand the system dynamics, in particular the [[system-dynamics-attractors\|attractors]] in the system. For instance, a [[system-dynamics-attractors\|point-attractor]] in a learning system might be the state of "being relatively engaged". Of critical concern is the [[system-dynamics-transition\|transition]] between states. 

If we say this is needed then:

> [!quote] Time-series data is critical for system dynamics
> This has profound consequences for both measurement and data analyses. With respect to measurement, a complex systems lens necessitates the collection of time series data.
> ...a complex systems perspective requires collecting repeated measurements for each individual.
