# Notes

Outlines that **Learning is a complex process**, first section.  

Defines [[complexity\|complexity]] loosely, but notes that different fields approach this differently. A more mathematical view would be found with Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity and information theory ( #getref Edward W Packel and JF Traub. 1987. Information-based complexity.
