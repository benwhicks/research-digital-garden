#mathematical-modelling/game-theory 

Modelling [[peer-feedback\|peer-feedback]] amongst psychology students. Seems to be more of a [[game-theoretic-explanations\|game-theoretic-explanations]] or informed model, rather than a new model (checking this...)

Is trying to fill the gap about the type and quality of the feedback that helps learning. 

Claims the conditions of the [[prisoners-dilemma\|prisoners-dilemma]] apply.

> In sum, the same conditions of prisonerâ€™s dilemma apply, and a similar prediction could be made across rounds of experience with peer feedback (across assignments) within a class: if peers provide less useful feedback, the student will also reduce the usefulness of the feedback the student provides in the next round, whereas if peers provide more useful feedback, the student will increase the usefulness of the feedback provided in the next round. 

Note that higher effort of reviewer means higher quality of feedback. "Nice job" doesn't cut it. 

Designs the study around applying a 'game-theory-perspective' on this. 

Primary outcome is 'long comments' in the feedback. The use of game theory is really around prior results around the [[prisoners-dilemma\|PD]] dynamics informing the design of the system and the choice of analysis. The use GT to come up with four hypothesis, which they then test in the experiment. Results below:
