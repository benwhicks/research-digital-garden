Can we use [[implied-conditional-independencies\|implied-conditional-independencies]] to test the validity of the model against the data?

Can use the model for [[data-generation\|data-generation]]? i.e. can we simulate data and then check against the [[phenomena\|phenomena]] of interest to see if it matches out expectations (this is part of the [[TCM\|TCM]] methodology)
