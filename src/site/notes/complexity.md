Information / mathematical based approach

Cnyfin / systems based

Early work by Löfgren ( #getref Lars Löfgren. 1977. Complexity of descriptions of systems: A foundational study. International Journal Of General System 3, 4 (1977), 197–214.) and Rosen ( #getref Robert Rosen. 1991. Life itself: a comprehensive inquiry into the nature, origin, and fabrication of life. Columbia University Press.) also good, and [[Sources/@kittoPlacesInterveneComplex2024\|@kittoPlacesInterveneComplex2024]] believe these frameworks are "particularly relevant for the purposes of modelling and understanding learning *and* the environments in which it occurs."

# Many different ways

> One notable attempt to clarify this ambiguity ended in 1997, with the identification of over 200 definitions of complexity and no clear consensus ( #getref Bruce Edmonds. 1997. Hypertext bibliography of measures of complexity. Technical Report. https://bruce.edmonds.name/combib/)
