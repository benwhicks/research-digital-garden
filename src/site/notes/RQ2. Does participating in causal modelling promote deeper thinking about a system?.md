#participatory-modelling 
When participants partake in a [[participatory-causal-modelling\|participatory-causal-modelling]] session, does this help their thinking about the system in question? Do they notice anything new, that they perhaps would not have otherwise? Does it help them think deeper? More broadly? More abstractly? Is this, in some way, better?

This is challenging to measure - [[problem-of-measuring-thinking\|problem-of-measuring-thinking]]. 

### Who?
If someone who has never thought about the system in question then the answer to RQ2 is trivial, so it will be important to understand [[RQ2.1. What level of context expertise do participants have?\|RQ2.1. What level of context expertise do participants have?]]

### Types of deepening

#### The visual formalism promoting thinking

#### The abstraction constraints promoting thinking


### New insights

Part of this will be answered in pre- and post- questions to ascertain [[RQ2.2. Does participants view of the system change?\|RQ2.2. Does participants view of the system change?]], by asking:

* For participants to bring or draw their current understanding of the system (the final [[graphical-causal-model\|GCM]] will be their post understanding of the system). 
* What are the challenges to understanding their system?
* What are good potential ways to move forward in understanding their system?
